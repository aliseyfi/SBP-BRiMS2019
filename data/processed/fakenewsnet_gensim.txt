woke up this morning to find variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed bill clinton natural for foundation donors to seek favors here google naturally my reaction was oh what did bill clinton do to damage his wife campaign now of course the headline sounds really really awful it plays right into the idea that the clinton foundation is all about pay to play just like donald trump has been saying all along unfortunately it takes reading beyond the headlines which is something most people don do to find out the real story and the real story is that there is no pay to play it was natural for people who ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things and trusted the state department wouldn do anything they shouldn do clinton told npr in an interview that aired monday morning source cnn in other words people can ask for favors but that certainly doesn mean they ll get them leaked emails have shown that some clinton foundation donors have gotten meetings with clinton and that others were turned down there is zero evidence of pay to play in other words people might have asked for favors but there no evidence they got them now let talk about the foundation the media doesn like to mention the trump foundation trump hasn given to his own foundation since he does collect money from others though and gives it in his name he also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets all for himself but out of charity money new york attorney general eric schneiderman said in september cnn interview that his office is investigating trump charitable foundation over concerns that it engaged in some impropriety as related to new york charity laws the investigation launched amid reports from the washington post that trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself such as oil painting of himself and autographed football helmet and also recycled others contributions to make them appear to have come from him although he hasn given to the foundation since source media matters media matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote trump at the cost of clinton candidacy journalists have been criticized for the double standard in the ways they cover trump and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton earlier this month cable news programs devoted times more coverage to clinton pneumonia diagnosis as the washington post reporting about the trump foundation this week both the trump foundation and trump organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of donald trump dr oz stunt all of this biased coverage is hurting clinton and helping trump trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks largely because the media covers every minor clinton scandal if you call getting sick scandal while ignoring every scandal in trump closet and trust me there are lot featured image via ethan miller getty images
proof the mainstream media is manipulating the election by taking bill clinton out of context
former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative chai distributed watered down hiv aids drugs to patients in sub saharan africa and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality according to draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation the congressional report titled the clinton foundation and the india success story was initiated by rep marsha blackburn tennessee republican and vice chair of the house energy and commerce committee the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundation most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative the congressional report focused on clinton decade long relationship with controversial indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy which chai used as one of its main distributors of hiv aids drugs to third world countries it also highlighted the work of dinesh thakur former ranbaxy employee who became star whistleblower and permitted the government to launch landmark lawsuit against the indian firm the company was vulnerable to prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the market ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce the department of justice further levied million fine and forfeiture on the company this is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the district of maryland and the nation largest financial penalty paid by generic pharmaceutical company said attorney for the district of maryland rod rosenstein when ranbaxy pleaded guilty when companies sell adulterated drugs they undermine the integrity of the fda approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard ineffective or unsafe said stuart delery acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the department of justice when the government announced its action against the indian company the department of justice stated in its final settlement alleged due to the company diluted drugs it subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality according to the report the question becomes how many people lost their lives how many people found it was false promise asked blackburn in an interview with thedcnf the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clinton campaign blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the department of health and human services and to the department of state where hillary served as secretary of state during president barack obama first term the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indian americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration fda and the securities and exchange commission the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundation vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the watered down drugs propublica estimated that in alone the agency for international development allocated million to ranbaxy and delivered more than million packages substandard hiv medicines cause health problems for patients perhaps even accelerating death from hiv related infections roger bate an economist at the american enterprise institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines told thedcnf thakur told thedcnf that many of the company anti retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in aids patients these drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients if the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label you will not see the platelet levels or the wbc levels stabilize he said ranbaxy first public hint of problems occurred in august one year after chai began working with the firm the world health organization reported irregularities involving three ranbaxy drugs in south africa according to the report the fda sent public warning letter to ranbaxy in about reported irregularities in the company quality control efforts it concluded that the drugs which included anti retroviral hiv aids medications show much lower potencies in these batches although ranbaxy generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the chai and the former president continue to praise ranbaxy and distribute the company hiv aid drugs to patients abroad bill heaped praise on ranbaxy in during speech in mumbai saying the drugs saved millions of lives neither chai nor the clinton foundation have announced they severed ties with ranbaxy thakur said he now public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on access to patients the whistleblower tried to meet with chai and clinton foundation officials but was only met with silence have tried to reach out to them he told thedcnf but haven had great amount of success with the clinton foundation chai was part of the clinton foundation until when it spun off into separate entity the groups still have some overlapping board members and staff and they continue to operate in close coordination bill clinton for example is deeply involved with both organizations charles ortel wall street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the clinton foundation claims their separation was deeply suspect in the application trustees of the new entity including bill clinton falsely claim the entity is not successor to previous efforts this is not true they purposefully obscure the fact that similar operation called chai was by far the largest piece of the original foundation ortel told thedcnf the congressional study suggests bill may have relaxed quality standards in executive order he signed an executive order that relaxed intellectual property policy standards promising the government would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any sub saharan country relating to hiv aids medicines or technologies the report states chai announced in october it was going to distribute generic low cost hiv drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers ranbaxy cipla of mumbai india matrix labs of hydrabad india aspen pharmacare of johannesburg south africa chai endorsement also allowed ranbaxy to manufacture hiv drugs that would be bought by the government under the president emergency plan for aids relief billion initiative proposed by former president george bush the flow of funds combined with clinton endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become good acquisition targets according to the study ranbaxy filed abbreviated new drug applications three of which were approved by the fda according to the congressional study eventually the firm would produce generic hiv drugs the companies enjoyed great financial profits and they exploded as they partnered with the foundation for several years the report states the study also examined the key players in the clinton chai orbit the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the clinton foundation in terms of donor contributions one relationship unearthed by the report was the american indian foundation which clinton co founded with indian american businessmen rajat gupta and vinod gupta in rajat was convicted of insider trading in in sensational trial vinod eventually was forced to resign as ceo and chairman of the company infogroup and was fined million in securities and exchange commission investigation one of the charges stated vinod had awarded bill million without board approval blackburn says the worst part of the story were the false hopes offered by the clinton foundation you think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients to me it disturbing and very sad she said the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those

donald trump is well deplorable he suggested building wall to keep invading hordes of brown skinned rapists and drug dealers from charging into the country gotten on board with creating national registry for muslims like hitler did with the jews forcing said muslims to wear special identification badges and even rounding them up into modern day concentration camps as temporary measure he even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad the other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families when you get these terrorists you have to take out their families they care about their lives don kid yourself when they say they don care about their lives you have to take out their families but he not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas he also wants to bring that idea home in statement on the bombings in new york and new jersey over the weekend the donald senior communications advisor explained that trump is not fighting terrorism he fighting the narratives of barack obama and hillary clinton and trump narrative is kill them all last weekend attacks which are just the latest to be carried out on soil on president obama watch should be wakeup call for every american it is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full citizenship because of the failed policies supported by president obama and hillary clinton even worse clinton must explain her reckless support for increase in syrian refugees and her push for an all out open border policy which will put even more americans at risk the threat from radical islamic terrorism has only grown under obama and clinton and isis has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational our enemies neither fear nor respect hillary clinton and as nation that is dangerous and it is disgraceful mr trump will bring an end to these attacks because unlike obama and clinton he believes we re in more than fight about narratives these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens pay attention to that last bit they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens now we already know that the problem according to the gop presidential nominee is radical islamic terrorism and that trump has numerous times blamed muslims in general for any attacks he could exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating terrorists they re protecting each other but they re really doing very bad damage they have to open up to society and report the bad ones trump said in march when they see trouble they have to report it they are absolutely not reporting it and that big problem if muslims are protecting terrorists are they not terrorists in trump eyes how many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows islam was rounded up would there be mass exterminations trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists families how would he define terrorism these are all questions it is unlikely that mr trump will answer for himself but remember he is exactly the sort of person who with wink and nod suggests disarming his political opponents security to see what happens to them shortly after suggesting that second amendment people could deal with them we re dealing with an unstable constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the little red button that launches our nuclear arsenal it also important to remember that the attacks in new york and new jersey were committed by an american citizen one with constitutional rights no matter how much someone wants to call for blood this of course matters not to the donald normally suggesting that candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole but not with trump he said it himself many times if we allow this alleged human this oompa loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation to assume office it will not end well be sure to vote in november if it the last thing you do if trump wins it may be featured image via getty images joe raedle

when president obama spoke at the united nations he espoused the one world government he speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms as if it is the do all be all for all the problems in the world also in the speech he referred to true democracy if that is what he is for then god help us as written by alex pfeiffer for daily caller collision of cultures in his last address before the united nations tuesday president barack obama acknowledged that globalism has led to collision of cultures but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward obama said in order to move forward though we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires course correction the president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought

back when the news first broke about the pay to play corruption involving then secretary of state hillary clinton and the clinton foundation where donors to the foundation were granted political access including lavish white house state dinners the clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed good that the foundation has done over the years don think anyone was fooled into thinking that the clinton foundation was anything other than money making machine for the clinton family and their well connected friends the foundation had to at least have the appearance of being charity so they had to divert some of their resources to causes that way they could always point to those grants as evidence that they re an organization for good the daily caller reported that only percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity just percent of the clinton foundation massive budget actually went to charitable grants according to the tax exempt organization irs filings the rest went to salaries and employee benefits fundraising and other expenses the clinton foundation spent hair under million in the organization irs filings show but less than million of that went to charitable grants that number pales in comparison to the million the foundation spent on salaries compensation and employee benefits another million was marked as other expenses while the remaining almost was marked as professional fundraising expenses despite taking in an additional million in the clinton foundation spent percent less on charitable grants in than in even as it slashed charitable spending the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries employee benefits and compensation by million in the foundation also spent million more other expenses in sometimes things are exactly as they appear this was nothing more than way for the clintons to make massive amounts of money and hillary used her position as secretary of state to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

can wait for weekend at chelsea to hit the big screen cnn and the rest of hillary clinton slobbering media sycophants have already written the script if this woman god forbid dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow these doting suck ups these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has understandably reached an all time low would dutifully parrot the clinton campaign talking points and call it minor setback to her inevitable victory the american people aren buying it this is severely ill woman no more conspiracy theory dismissals mrs clinton mild cold er seasonal allergies mean heat exhaustion that is to say minor case of pneumonia is evidently of the rare kind that requires permanent traveling physician and mystery man who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable episodes or otherwise freezes up with brain short circuit during speech this guy has been spotted with the clintons during medical emergencies going back to when hillary suffered brain blood clot also covered up and carries in hand what many medical experts say is diazepam pen diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures blue tinted glasses of the sort mrs clinton was wearing sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures these therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of parkinson disease neurological disorder from which number of doctors indicate mrs clinton likely suffers since when has pneumonia required neurological squeeze test the clinton campaign needs to come clean they won but they should wonder what official diagnosis we ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm secret service agents acting as though they ve been there hundred times before nothing to see here folks secretary clinton sciatica is just acting up bit from the miles she powered through yesterday going door to door the point is that once more by lying about illness mrs clinton has reinforced and justified concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president she proven yet again that she can be trusted she has confirmed number of pre conceptions that voters as revealed by her historically low approval ratings have formed relative to her health and character she liar that her default mode she corrupt and she sick very sick she puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else including the best interests of the nation and even her own life do take joy in mrs clinton sufferings and plummeting poll numbers well no on the first yes on the second do not gloat when your enemy falls when they stumble do not let your heart rejoice proverbs indeed mrs clinton has had very bad week but her poll numbers were already trending downward her medical crisis over the weekend coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of donald trump supporters as racist and irredeemable basket of deplorables has only served to accelerate the plunge perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such statement especially by this particular woman this is the same hillary clinton who once called the late sen robert byrd va her friend and mentor sen byrd of course was recruiter for the actually deplorable kkk this is the same hillary clinton whose husband former president bill clinton was caught jokingin that president obama should be carrying his bags the same woman whose democratic party opposed the civil rights act while republicans not unlike those she just slandered worked hard to pass it finally and going back bit further this is the same hillary clinton whose party fought war to maintain slavery in the while hundreds of thousands of republicans gave up their lives to free them who the racist praying for hillary clinton despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie our eyes have been telling us the truth for months maybe even years now to watch this increasingly frail bitter and elderly woman stiffen up convulse and collapse into the arms of well practiced staffers is hard to stomach you can help but feel some modicum of compassion for her wicked though she may be it almost tragic to witness hillary clinton has lived her entire life for this moment everything she ever done or said and the mounding piles of lecherous bs she put up with from her sexually predatory partner in crime has been designed to place her in the oval office not as first lady but as president of the united states proverbs says many are the plans in person heart but it is the lord purpose that prevails am saying there no chance hillary clinton will win not at all though think it unlikely between her devoted media harpies her team of around the clock doctors and campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover up there always chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory still it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for hillary clinton political aspirations even so also pray she might live long and healthy life in the private sector

obama made real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the assembly during it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating isis and other islamic extremist groups in syria and otherwise he spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his jv team seeing as the is the global police force he said that we have no chance of winning this battle the daily caller reports that obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the islamic state group he cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution if we are honest we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long said obama president obama continued by saying that we must be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy he mentioned briefly that there will be military aspect to dealing with the islamic state group he also categorized syria as place like syria where there no ultimate military victory to be won instead obama suggested that we pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect which may prove to be little difficult since these people are not the most reasonable people to try to deal with it likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical islam and death and violence these are the same people that would just as quickly chastise christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch bullet for suspected muslim terrorist it this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some jv team get us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse it about time we start calling it like it is and taking action we re past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone feelings if we don take action soon then obama pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become reality make sure to share this on facebook if you think it time we take action against the very real threat that is radical islam source conservative tribune

thanks in part to the of defense intelligence documents connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most middle east observers have suspected all along that the rise of the terrorist group isis and the likelihood of establishing terror state caliphate had been predicated by both the cia and dia as far back as and purposely created by the obama administration in part to isolate the syrian government of president bashar al assad the documents also predicted that the support given by the west turkey and the persian gulf arab states to the takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of salafist principality in eastern syria according to investigative reporter nafeez ahmed the leaked document reveals that in coordination with the gulf states and turkey the west intentionally sponsored violent islamist groups to destabilize assad despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an islamic state in iraq and syria obviously obama dismissal of isis being nothing more than jv team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping residual force in place in iraq seems to be as the documents indicate considerably more sinister than first assumed in that not leaving contingency force behind was viewed by most middle eastern experts to have been simple yet costly tactical error however the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside libya before the terror attack in benghazi and the report leaves no doubt that intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from benghazi to syrian ports however what isn in dispute is that american servicemen and woman and those in benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by clandestine middle eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our national security here is link to the judicial watch press release detailing the released documents here are the released documents themselves

it was late one night in the white house when obama first came up with the idea for isis he hadn been sleeping well michelle told him to take some deep breaths have some hot milk and rewatch princess bride but he made it all the way to the billy crystal scene and he was out of milk and michelle had started snoring the snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet sounding like broken boat was giving birth to another boat he had to get out of there first he headed down to the oval office and tried to sleep on the couch but it wasn long enough for his legs and it smelled like generals butts for long time he just wandered around the west wing alone he was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn he peeked into people desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies he was thinking about stealing kind bar off one of his interns desks when suddenly word appeared to him isis he grabbed post it note and wrote it down what was it what did it mean it wasn until months later at coachella that the idea started to take shape obama loved electronic music the beats the lights the djs the wonderful fans and every year for just one day the secret service allowed him to go to the music festival they would hang back and he would wear sunglasses flower crown neon tank top and tight european style bathing suit and just dance the people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they seen hey bro it the president yeah bro the president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping sick beat he had done tiny bit of molly with french canadian woman named bonjour when the word isis came back to him ever since he was little boy he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own he

yes actually she stopped eating her popsicle donald trump was right about you he nodded about everything he explained that he had actually been born in kenya in and that he was years old he made an american birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags honestly it took me like minutes he explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the united states so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside isn that the plot of the first season of homeland hillary asked obama nodded kind of also little bit of the americans no one had come close to guessing his secret until donald trump he didn know what had given it away he been so careful had donald trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his portuguese water dog bo wait what hillary asked she was starting to freak out obama explained that bo was actually supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in morse code to terrorist organizations around the world and he thought there was chance that donald trump had seen that bo eyes were really tiny led screens did you know that when bo barks obama said he just repeating the word dog over and over again in robot voice hillary was quiet for long time she had stopped eating her popsicle and the whole thing had just melted away now her fingers were stuck together and it looked like she had one weird fish hand when she finally spoke it was almost whisper you re year old kenyan muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy america obama nodded hillary made strange sound and cried out feel like short circuiting obama did his best to comfort her bo does that sometimes then he ll go outside and poop out printer cartridge hillary was breathing hard she walked the length of the kitchen then walked the width of the kitchen and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in aly raisman floor routine obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets but it was such relief he felt light and loose he felt again he took her hands into his sorry my fingers are stuck together like fish hand hillary apologized do you mean fin obama asked they both chuckled with their mouths closed hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything then he leaned down and said in soft strong voice but haven even told you the best part yet going to start my own terrorist group and call it isis isis no isis all caps hillary and obama talked for hours that night when they got tired of the kitchen they moved outside to the rose garden with six pack joint and like ton of cheese they lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy washington sky as obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer when she felt sleepy she put her head just inside one of his arms closed her eyes and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the western world wash over her like the hot summer air she interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night he said he didn want to talk about that and told her in cool way to stop smoking all the weed she interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take hit at the same time but he was not as impressed as she thought he be he told her like for real they had to focus right now on starting terrorist group and she laughed for what felt like an hour and minutes he was starting to regret telling her about isis when suddenly she sat up looked him right in the eye and said we ll wait until president and then we will secretly destroy america together her words shot through him his heart was beating fast that was it that was the plan he had been waiting for and it was beautiful in the dim light he could see dirt sticking to her face where the popsicle had been she looked scary like jodie foster in nell weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair he couldn stop smiling for the first time in his life he felt completely understood they put their heads back in the grass and he tried to remember the lyrics to wonderwall as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair pretty soon it was morning again

posted by frank wilkenmeyer on sep we ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong one of the most famous is probably read my lips no new taxes moment in time that won an election and lost the next after george hw bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases what donald trump just promised as reaction to the attacks over the weekend in chelsea and minnesota may have that beat jasonmillerindc statement on last weekend terror attacks pic twitter com evtvlcfo official team trump teamtrump september take look at that and consider what it says the personal attacks on president obama and secretary clinton aside trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in america he didn promise to increase funding to counter terrorism units or deliver plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil let imagine for moment that trump actually tried to implement this plan of his destroy doesn leave much to the imagination while the mouth breathers who support him are probably giving this statement hearty yeeeeehaw the reality is that he talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in america he talking about profiling muslims he talking about donald trump version of the patriot act where nobody with brown skin is safe the man being hunted by the fbi for example isn just muslim he an the man being hunted by the fbi for example isn just muslim he an american citizen with the right to due process just because he suspect in bombing doesn mean he guilty of setting off bombs with this blanket trump statement however this man would be in deck of cards marked kill and not on the most wanted list there nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship constitutional rights or due process would come into play what that means is that under trump dream regime we could expect muslim heavy neighborhoods like dearborn and queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return without way to differentiate christian arabs from muslims would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot if you think being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an american presidential candidate is leaning read that statement one more time it isn about the narrative it isn about prevention or education it about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs it may sound good to bunch of knuckle draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means donald trump just became even more frightening the only solace we have is that what he promising is nothing but another read my lips terrorism isn something you can simply destroy just because you said so the thought of turning our streets into denzel washington movie might get you few more votes from the daft but it isn going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism like the rest of donald trump campaign in the end this is nothing more than bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak minded gullible morons featured image from file

daisy of rerun am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in presidential campaigning that being the tv advertisement of an innocent little girl sitting in field picking daisy petals one by one while mushroom cloud arises in most sinister fashion behind her the year was and the incumbent president lyndon johnson approved that message only problem was that he followed the course in vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly war mongering opponent barry goldwater today as our history books find difficulty in revisiting johnson deceitful war policies goldwater vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our nation media mention this as backdrop of our current presidential campaign just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made only this time that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each clinton failure such rendering depicting reasons why clinton is unworthy of the presidency would be shattering to her campaign obviously this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that daisy remake aimed against trump has been mentioned that being said such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the clinton staffers somehow if those daisy petals could be offered against clinton as previously mentioned its message could outweigh goldwater deception when based upon the accuracy of recent events instead today voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as news and views with the recent about face announcement from ted cruz the media reaction of ridicule was to be expected now another unbalanced ap report unfolded this one detailing ted dramatic about face that may help unite deeply divided republican party this in addition to previous statements in which cruz called trump pathological liar and utterly amoral as the article relates trump countered with his nickname of lyin ted insulted his wife and linked his father to the john kennedy assassination these actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder schools of journalism teach that americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans so is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article even within the closing paragraph since many readers turn off after one paragraph another safeguard of derogatory story which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short lived say derogatory when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and or individuals this exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the liberal press moniker has now everyday acceptance it is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from pertinent event this extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public re airing also the blatant public disservice when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the ap ignores needs no further explanation also with the first debate squarely in view the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the candy crowley faux pas especially annoying is the unchanged format and sum of the personnel who will rule this forum in an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its ap exclusion these quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections with that consider the president past considerations of today democrat candidate his hopeful successor when back during the primary obama stated of hillary she will say anything and change nothing hillary can be trusted and isn qualified to be president obviously the deception and the intentional abandonment along with the two weeks of lying about benghazi had yet to occur not only is this pertinent it damning given the time frame also during that same campaign future first lady michelle offered this opine if you can run your own house you certainly can run the white house apparently that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent it is omitted from an equal public review again wouldn it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial only this time with documentation for each petal that type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of mushroom cloud the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

the democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly if you question the veracity of black president birth certificate you are racist that is the outright claim of lynn sweet washington bureau chief for the chicago sun times made on fox news consider the slanted claim that if president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be racist what is wrong with this obvious non sequitur first of all there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered this is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist secondly the social security number presented of barack obama was issued in connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there third the hospital that issued his birth certificate in hawaii didn exist when it was issued fourth an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification has an unquestioned birth certificate ever been presented no only cry of racism when the request is made they can produce an original document and they then rely on the smear of birther and racism to substantiate that which they can produce no physical evidence of sadly donald trump has bowed to their the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

the fbi has issued letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against hillary clinton use of private mail server the new evidence was discovered during an investigation into anthony weiner who was caught sexting with year old girl and who is the estranged husband of clinton top aide huma abedin apparently abedin and weiner shared laptop that potentially contained tens of thousands of mails from abedin including mails she forwarded to herself from hillary mail account which were not turned into the fbi what this might mean is many of the deleted hillary mails were likely just recovered by the fbi if any of the mails are work related or classified that means both hillary and huma abedin lied to the fbi during their original investigation lying to the fbi is illegal and that alone is enough to prosecute hillary clinton and huma abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed this story is still developing but considering the fact the fbi released this letter just days before the election means they found something serious on july th fbi director james comey laid out the evidence against hillary clinton use of private mail server and mishandling of classified information but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her since then many high ranking officials within the fbi and other intelligence agencies have expressed dismay and disgust with director comey decision meanwhile many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the fbi high ranking fbi official told fox news that while it might not have been unanimous decision it was unanimous that we all wanted her clinton security clearance yanked it is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted the senior fbi official told fox news we were floored while listening to the fbi briefing because comey laid it all out and then said but we are doing nothing which made no sense to us fox news update october the fbi has released page summary pertaining to the fbi investigation into hillary clinton private mail server the documents claim state department official pressured the fbi into declassifying information in one of clinton mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts both the fbi and state department deny the deal was ever struck the fbi summary also revealed number of other questionable issues including group of state department officials that some called the shadow government who met weekly to discuss freedom of information requests related to hillary clinton as well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by hillary clinton and her staff as secretary of state there was even one incident where clinton ignored security advice that placed clinton her staff the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct photo opportunity for her election campaign bbc news update october according to the the wall street journal longtime clinton supporter donated nearly to an fbi official wife who later investigated hillary clinton use of private mail server uncovering the cover up reddit exposes paul combetta in september of several reddit users exposed the identity of reddit user stonetear as paul combetta an it specialist who worked on hillary clinton private mail server in fact mr combetta was granted immunity by the justice department for his involvement in the investigation even though paul combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over mails from clinton private mail server mr combetta posted question on exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the mail address of vip from bunch of archived mails it was assumed at the time that the vip being referenced in the post was hillary clinton however new evidence released today suggests the vip was in fact the president of the united states of america wikileaks podesta mails release october on march just hours after hillary clinton had been issued subpoenaed by the justice department john podesta the chairman of the hillary clinton campaign sent an mail to cheryl mills an attorney who works for the clinton campaign from john podesta gmail com to cheryl mills gmail com date subject special category think we should hold emails to and from potus that the heart of his exec privilege we could get them to ask for that they may not care but seems like they will in other words those deleted mails we keep hearing about contain hillary clinton communications with president obama which means both hillary clinton and obama lied to the fbi justice department congress and the american people we now have definitive proof obama was communicating with hillary clinton on her private mail server and knew she was using private mail server despite his claims otherwise update october wikileaks podesta mails release confirms intent of cover up on march th president obama lied to the press and told the american people he found about hillary clinton private mail server at the same time as the public cheryl mills an attorney for the clinton campaign then mails john podesta the same day longtime clinton supporter donated nearly to an fbi official wife who later investigated hillary clinton use of private mail server fwd potus on hrc emails from cheryl mills gmail com to john podesta gmail com date subject fwd potus on hrc emails we need to clean this up he has emails from her they do not say state gov forwarded message begin forwarded message from josh schwerin wrote find it odd the nyt didn actually quote the president saying what in their headline especially since the story has disbelieving tone to his not noticing one of us should connect with the wh just so they know that the email will show his statement to not make sense happy to do so to josh earnest since jen is in weird position unless cheryl or john you want to or already have with someone else but it not unreasonable to assume that josh is going to get asked how this was possible and he should have the factset especially if it some weird technical thing with the president email setup that he doesn see addresses to make matters even worse for the cover up in another leaked mail erika rottenberg another clinton attorney admits hillary clinton personally deleted many of the mails herself without oversight know when talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren satisfied with answers to date while we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok secure appropriate to use private server for secure documents and why further hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle chance to weigh in it smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing ve either gotten discovery sanctions for fired people for etc the reason fbi director comey did not press charges against hillary clinton was due to lack of intent he made the argument that hillary clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent and therefore did not commit provable crime however that was before the american people knew that hillary clinton was using private insecure mail server to communicate with president obama and before we had proof that hillary clinton deleted mails personally she also instructed paul combetta to remove evidence of the mails permanently and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the justice department this proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself and her boss president obama this suggests the white house illegally subverted the fbi investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced judge she would have to reveal the president communications with her meanwhile by protecting hillary the white house was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up by securing the white house for another years it will prevent the american people from ever finding out what is contained in those mails when you consider these facts as well as the other revelations within the podesta mails on wikileaks it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the clinton campaign and the white house in effect the white house is using the main stream media to elect clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy and hide the truth from the fbi congress and the american people timeline of events march the new york times breaks the story that clinton used personal mail account while secretary of state march the benghazi committee issues subpoena requiring preservation of all mails march barack obama states he only learned about the private mail

germany chancellor angela merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many syrian refugees as possible adopting literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants this quickly turned into horror show as crime was unleashed onto german cities with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year the german people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in germany because they just dealt crushing blow to merkel conservative democrat party and voted them out by large margin merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided and that she regrets the mistake she made also referring to as living lie according to the daily mail speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis we can do this but effectively admitted germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx continuation of the current influx would in the long term overwhelm the state and society even in country like germany she said the leader once known as the iron chancellor won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face however she resisted calls to set limit on the number of arrivals we want to and we will noticeably reduce the number of refugees she told the conference in karlsruhe with an approach focused on the german european and global level we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration here she is saying that is living lie yes of course when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with western values it not great for free society but as long as these flip flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they re not part of the problem then we will never get anywhere beware america beware source daily mail

shares facebook twitter german chancellor angela merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would she is also admitting she is willing to consider new policy direction merkel told the media at press conference if knew what change in refugee policy the people in germany want would be prepared to consider it these comments came shortly after the defeat of the christian democratic union in berlin sunday elections she also said if could would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in for which we were rather unprepared she took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the mecklenburg vorpommern election callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader the results of the edition are considered to be as result of the anti migrant sentiment many germans now have as well as the rise of the anti mass migration alternative for germany known as afd these factors have forced merkel to at least consider change in her stance regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets in other words it is all talk and no walk she is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want however she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the christian social union they have notoriously called for cap on the migrants coming into germany each year they specifically want to cap it at as well they want to prioritize christian migrants over muslims but merkle will not budge on that merkel stated if people don want muslim asylum seekers purely because of their religion that is contrary to our party principles and to germany the cdu and cannot go along with that christian social union party leader horst seehofer threatened to withdraw support for merkle during her campaign specifically for not implementing the migrant cap the campaign will be in the federal election he said it is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election the growing anti migrant atmosphere has been direct result of an increase in terrorism increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees understandably so if it ain broke don fix it this could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election or at least win by an only marginal amount serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as president obama and hillary clinton she is no different which is why many americans too cannot stand her

we need border wall it is not just matter of preventing illegal immigration but securing an essential access point into america law enforcement is on high alert after routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions police in luna county new mexico pulled over an undocumented middle eastern woman with the plans for nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area via mad news world police were unable to determine why the woman described as an islamic refugee was in possession of the plans but many are fearing the worst the plans detailed pipeline in deming new mexico the fbi joint terrorism task force was deployed with the border patrol to investigate the area the search came up empty the pipeline identified in the muslim woman plans is fairly remote leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack it is troubling to discover an undocumented muslim woman in county sharing border with mexico report released by judicial watch in revealed that mexican cartels were working with terror organizations the report indicates that mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror plagued nations into our country judicial watch also revealed in report that mexico based islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into america to scout out potential targets congress should approve funding for president trump border wall at once it is not merely matter of preventing illegal immigration many nefarious groups such as terrorists and drug cartels are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into america many of the illegal immigrants entering america are not even from mexico instead aliens from south of mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the american mexican border many of these aliens receive active support from the mexican government who cannot support the illegal immigrants if terrorist wanted to sneak into america to launch an attack they could easily travel across the southern border they could start their journey south of mexico arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers the only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing wall on the southern border until we do our country is easy pickings

we re shocked shocked to learn that cnn bias is so blatant in just about everything they do not simply in reporting the news first came lester holt unbelievably one sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked donald trump record and answers while leaving hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals now cnn has upped the ante on their own bias with poll that isn worth paper it was printed on according to their post debate poll of respondents indicated that hillary won the debate but what cnn didn bother to highlight is the fact that fully only of those polled were republicans while independents made of democrats comprised whopping of those polled not to be outdone nbc followed up with similar poll in which there were more democrats than republicans
cnn post debate rigged poll busted here are the real results
shares facebook twitter seahawks quarterback russell wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for god and his fellow man in fact it is one of his life purposes to serve and help his brothers and sisters in changing lives to be better helping others to get on path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life on the field he as quarterback wilson is all about winning off the field he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in god for this reason it is no surprise that when the nfl told wilson to not speak about his faith he learned he could still share his love for god and message of hope by his actions words were not necessary he has stated many times that in his life god comes first family and friends second and football third dedication to what is most important to him is his strength in terms of my faith my faith is everything god comes first family and friends come second and football comes third wilson concluded think when you keep it in that order great things happen to you you don stress out about much it beautiful thing to see man with voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing good message we have far too many people in high places who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in god to do good things in their life then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to themselves or worse forget where they came from and who brought them there luck no such thing good men hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is key skill of the very leadership that runs this country especially now in obama america you might walk into room of opportunity to make change with good intentions but once in there if you do not share in the example that wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share corruption can and will take root so the nfl told him not to talk about his faith interesting how things seem so one sided right don talk about god it hurts people feelings but feel free to disrespect and spread message of dishonoring your country and it heroes with this kind of garbage happening the truth becomes that much more obvious words like tolerance are being used to blur the line between good and evil right and wrong when you have men like wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in the backlash is deep ask yourself when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad there is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening and obama americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth
the nfl told russell wilson not to speak about his faith so he did something fans couldn believe freedom daily
someone had to say it okay liberals have been saying it for years fox news and increasingly the other news channels have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists pope francis agrees channeling franklin delano roosevelt infamous line we have nothing to fear but fear itself the pope chastised fear based media journalism based on gossip or rumors is form of terrorism and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively pope francis said on thursday spreading rumors is an example of terrorism of how you can kill person with your tongue he said this is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is very powerful weapon source reuters now to be fair pope francis was in italy and he was talking to italy press which has its own problems with nationalism but sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond after all fox spreads little but fear and that what has given us donald trump crime in the nation is down an american odds of being killed by terrorist is in million those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture still trump prompted on by fox news is scaring the crap out of americans fear is in the air and fear is surging americans are more afraid today than they have been in long time polls show majorities of americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than decade every week seems to bring new large or small scale terrorist attack at home or abroad mass shootings form constant drumbeat protests have shut down large cities repeatedly and some have turned violent overall crime rates may be down but sense of disorder is constant source the atlantic sure that about donald trump and the pope wasn directly talking about him but fox is the fear network forward progressives lists several examples of fox trying to scare the it out of people and if this election and polls are any indication they ve succeeded featured image via franco origlia getty images

shares facebook twitter cnn news has claimed through polling that hillary clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate but others indicate otherwise snap polls show donald trump as the debate night winner talking points included the birther movement allegations the email controversy and trump tax returns as well as other things look at some of the snap polls below they include time magazine the drudge report cbs new york fox and news nashville among many others donald trump took to twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate so far hillary clinton has yet to comment on it the cnn snap poll showed clinton at percent and trump at percent which is very large margin considering most polls show he won thus something nefarious has to be going on with that cnn poll or the pool of people polled is off people were polled by cnn but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more democrat which would explain the results despite clinton win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make difference in their voting so even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her regardless of these apparent winning results as donald trump would say he has complained that the media network gave him defective mic that he should have brought up bill clinton infidelity even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate which is odd considering he apparently won with the election about month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds let not forget that julian assange promised few months back an october surprise release on wikileaks that would destroy hillary clinton campaign we all must wait and see

posted by frank wilkenmeyer on sep how can you tell when man is so far gone that he obviously not fit to stand on stage for minutes that opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist but certainly there are warning signs donald trump has been running full steam now for months he constantly on the campaign trail under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest he year old man and he refuses to let up he been not only preparing for debate with world class politician no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth and to relax he flies to roanoke last minute to hold rally it obviously catching up to him sunday night less than hours before he set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life donald trump is showing signs that he simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end this incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated it shows that trump mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been talking point used to pander to somebody together it just gibberish five people killed in washington state by middle eastern immigrant many people died this weekend in ohio from drug overdoses riots donald trump realdonaldtrump september just what is he talking about if you re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you you talk about terrorism if you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle class like never before you talk about opioid deaths if you want to pander to your low hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in north carolina talking about them together shows just one thing trump is coming unhinged he obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate hillary clinton this could be the end of the line for the trump train featured image from file

secret video records massive hillary event flop soooo embarrassing for hillary clinton in delaware ohio clinton was supposed to have door knocking event at pm in the afternoon one guy who was documenting it for donald trump showed up he was it no one came at all when the staffers finally figured out who he was they had him leave but not before he got gander at whole lot of no one watched south park last week and they joked that clinton had maybe four supporters it looking more and more like that is just about right there are over million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the hildabeast from gateway pundit at hillary clinton ohio campaign headquarters volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the democratic presidential nominee but when this donald trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd he found no one there things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins book things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now in fact the only hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters when the man said he was trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were they quickly showed him the door the staffers for hillary clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves they must have been so disappointed the clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat it was clearly ready to handle large number of volunteers the fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble if this is the case in all states out there she will get clobbered by donald trump in the coming election wonder if you go to events like this in each state for clinton what you would find have feeling it will be eerily similar this has got to have the democrats in panic hillary clinton is supposed to be the favorite here the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election if that is true where is everyone trump rallies are packed with thousands of people he making her look ridiculous there is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for clinton at this point clinton is spending millions that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies to staff these offices when support is non existent like this you have to wonder what is the point between trump leading in the polls the enthusiasm factor hillary health her corruption and terrorism concerns it beginning to look more and more likely that the trumpster will be the next president

cnn furious and embarrassed after trump called them out for one major thing this weekend bombing in new york city rocked the nation as americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again donald trump responded to the attack almost immediately accurately describing it as bombing cnn for some inexplicable reason criticized him for that even though hillary clinton described the attack the exact same way so cnn edited out hillary wording and donald trump just ripped them new one for it in the cnn footage they only showed clinton responding to question from reporter where she agreed that trump was insensitive for calling the chelsea bombing bombing jake tapper played the same footage second time and again criticized trump for jumping to conclusions both times the network did not air clinton own description of the attack as bombing even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter question trump was interviewed on fox and friends and he held nothing back cnn is disgusting and disgraceful he declared these people are the most dishonest people cnn is so disgusting and dishonest and watch it it so unfair they call it the clinton news network she used the word bombs also by the way was criticized for calling it correctly what said was exactly correct things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins book things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now he also pointed the finger at stupid leaders going soft on terrorism well it mess and it shame and we re going to have to be very tough he said think we re going to see big change over the last couple of days think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country he explained that because we ve been weak out country been weak we re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands and as ve been saying you ve got to stop it realdonaldtrump slams dishonest cnn for editing out clinton reference to nyc explosion as bombing pic twitter com eg yy fox friends foxandfriends september obama was heavily criticized by trump for his plan to accept over syrian refugees in and hillary wants to make that number even higher according to trump hillary clinton wants to increase what he letting in and he letting in thousands of thousands of people they can be properly vetted said trump he let in over additional people and now hillary clinton is raising it by per cent thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we re doing our leaders are don even say weak say stupid

back when the news first broke about the pay to play corruption involving then secretary of state hillary clinton and the clinton foundation where donors to the foundation were granted political access including lavish white house state dinners the clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed good that the foundation has done over the years don think anyone was fooled into thinking that the clinton foundation was anything other than money making machine for the clinton family and their well connected friends the foundation had to at least have the appearance of being charity so they had to divert some of their resources to causes that way they could always point to those grants as evidence that they re an organization for good the daily caller reported that only percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity just percent of the clinton foundation massive budget actually went to charitable grants according to the tax exempt organization irs filings the rest went to salaries and employee benefits fundraising and other expenses the clinton foundation spent hair under million in the organization irs filings show but less than million of that went to charitable grants that number pales in comparison to the million the foundation spent on salaries compensation and employee benefits another million was marked as other expenses while the remaining almost was marked as professional fundraising expenses despite taking in an additional million in the clinton foundation spent percent less on charitable grants in than in even as it slashed charitable spending the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries employee benefits and compensation by million in the foundation also spent million more other expenses in sometimes things are exactly as they appear this was nothing more than way for the clintons to make massive amounts of money and hillary used her position as secretary of state to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

obama speech in new york shocks americans when he says this about attacks would say our president is useless but really this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance he has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this this is just tone deaf to the nth power guessing that if you re reading this right now you keep up with the news or at least have tendency to follow breaking events that being the case you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in new york and new jersey over the weekend as well as the stabbing that occurred in st cloud minnesota while you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials you would be wrong surely you want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism especially on our own soil surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much if not because they actually mean it then for votes in the upcoming election things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins book things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now well apparently your president doesn have any such feelings about the matter in fact not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in new york he ignored them in favor of speaking at high dollar fundraiser are you outraged yet it gets better in lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred he lamented the sexism he says has been pushed by the likes of rush limbaugh and fox news who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet ve ever seen including msnbc claiming that they are the reason hillary clinton campaign is going down the tubes he bashed trump while lauding hillary as some kind of savior while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror related critics will say that he didn have enough information to make an informed statement at the time but you don have to know every single detail to say an explosion has taken place here in new york and would like to take moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers and would ask you guys to do the same will be making more in depth statement later as receive more details and then move on to the business of the hour but no he couldn even be bothered to do that disgusting

over the past several months the american public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the clinton foundation since hillary clinton was secretary of state well new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought according to the daily caller the foundation aids program distributed watered down drugs to third world countries from the daily caller former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative chai distributed watered down hiv aids drugs to patients in sub saharan africa and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality according to draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundation most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clinton campaign the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indian americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration fda and the securities and exchange commission the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundation vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the watered down drugs this latest report proves that the clinton foundation should be shut down immediately rather than serve as means of enriching bill and hillary do you think that the clinton foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world share your thoughts below

according to this the arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities case in point the specific law criminalizes any contact between an adult and child genitals so if you re parent of child and you ve changed his her diaper or given him her bath you re felon for real this is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from intentionally or knowingly touching the genitals of child under the age of of course their intention is to protect children from child molesters but because they don know how to write effective legislation az parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids the az supreme court then decided to double down insisting that prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct they ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent so much for innocent until proven guilty right in others words just trust the prosecutors all there no need to rewrite or revise terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior because prosecutors will use common sense see just trust them wow there are whole bunch of legal implications to consider here and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink but here an especially interesting tidbit as fordham law professor john pfaff explains the majority logic has one final defect it utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining which is how more than percent of criminal cases in america are resolved given the immense expense and hassle of trial many defendants are pressured into striking deal with prosecutor trading lighter sentence for an admission of guilt arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of young child into taking plea deal on unrelated charges with the state supreme court help arizona child molestation laws have been weaponized into tool for prosecutorial harassment allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver out of spite or malice or simply to boost their conviction rates this terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state residents into unknowing criminals barring intervention by the supreme court due process has now been suspended for arizona parents and caregivers yikes but sure it ll all just work itself out we should just trust the government on this all because doesn government always know best

michelle obama not leaving the white house hillary clinton has terrifying new role for her the idea that might have to spend the next years continuing to cover the obamas is actually making me little ill was done with them after the first few days of the barack obama presidency but it would appear that hillary clinton has some roles for the president and first lady after her coronation election what exactly is first lady michelle obama legacy trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is bunch of crap or perhaps it will be the infamous for the first time in my life proud of my country personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her sign but why remember her when one of the presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration insert mechanical applause here but what would her role be what is she even qualified to do it not hard to figure out what hillary clinton wants her to do when you remember that clinton believes that the government should have major role in bringing up your children if you doubt that read this tweet things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins book things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now mean how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children for an additional wave of nausea read hillary go on and on about her faith and how it has led her to her progressive liberal ideology of course michelle obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids as reported by the washington post back in february she said at health care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids either do not have one or two year horizon for this work she said have rest of my life horizon this reeks of desperation is hillary trying to capture the don like hillary but do like the obamas vote or maybe she thinks that with woman of color at the helm people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because you know racism or something either way absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of american children the government is not one gigantic parental unit nor should it be viewed as one that is an extremely dangerous idea to have as nothing good has ever come out of complete government control over the average citizen

there already been hints from nbc news that lester holt the moderator for the first presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton will not be fact checking the candidates this of course will allow trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable except by hillary clinton but to make matters worse all cable news networks including those critical of trump are pledging to be completely spineless and will not offer any on screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong while on screen fact checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks including univision and telemundo said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics thus the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to holt the only other person on the stage after politico documented that trump lies on average every three and half minutes one would think fact checking process would be paramount to an honest open debate on the issues but sadly the media realizing their ratings are on the line would rather kowtow to donald trump and his band of deplorable surrogates the clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold trump accountable with clinton campaign communications director jennifer palmieri telling reporters for the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give donald trump an unfair advantage we do believe it is the role of the moderator to call out those lies and to do that in real time unfortunately with trump impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods it somehow up to hillary clinton to shine at the debate if she hopes to win this double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history just to look slightly better than him is abhorrent hopefully clinton will wipe the floor with trump on the first debate but with no one to back her up it may be hard convincing the american people that she did it if there is one thing this election has shown us it that journalism is dying if not already dead featured image via sara davis getty images
networks confirm they will not be fact checking donald trump in any way

america needs to get with the program when it comes to immigration yes we are nation of immigrants the proverbial melting pot more importantly we are united states of america there should be no more of this each to their own garbage when it comes to how immigrants want to live their lives if they want to stick with their own programs then they should have stayed put in their countries of origin via jewsnews quebec mayor gives muslim refugees little piece of his mind by spilling the truth that canadians don adapt to them it the other way around muslims must understand that they must adapt to canada its customs its traditions its way of life because it was the country that was chosen to emigrate you have to understand that they are the ones that they must integrate and learn to live in canada need to understand that they have to be for them to change their lifestyle not the canadians who so generously welcomed them you must understand that canadians are not racist or xenophobic we accept many immigrants in many countries with different cultures and religions contradicting to many muslim countries which do not accept immigrants non muslims for this reason the canadians are not willing to give up their identity and their culture finally they have to understand that in canada with its judeo christian roots christmas trees churches and religious festivals religion must remain in the private sphere the municipality of durval has the right to refuse any concessions to islam and sharia law for muslims who are not in agreement with the canadian culture and religion and do not feel comfortable in canada there are beautiful muslim countries in the world most of them under populated and ready to receive them with open arms in accordance with sharia law if you left his country to come to canada and not to muslim country it is because you have considered that life is better in canada than in other places help yourself to the question just once why is it better here in canada that where it comes from it boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives this is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans while most americans are perplexed as to how foreign entity could trump american law on our own sovereign soil texas isn waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute sharia law within the american judicial system because muslims cannot eat particular meal should mean they should bring their own the few should never out weigh the many especially when it comes to adopted culture adopt it or don just do block others from it boom there it is and that is the philosophy we ought to have integrate or vacate but don try to change us you will fail

this is true story general stanley mcchrystal was the commander of us forces in afghanistan and he had frequent disagreements on the conduct of the war with his commander in chief at one point mcchrystal was called into the oval office and he knew his army career was about to be over when former military commander in afghanistan stanley mcchrystal was called into the oval office by barack obama he knew things weren going to go well when the president accused him of not supporting him in his political role as president it not my job to support you as politician mr president it my job to support you as commander in chief mcchrystal replied and he handed obama his resignation barack obama has long history of hating the us military and men and women who serve he is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance not satisfied with accepting mcchrystal resignation the president made cheap parting shot bet when die you ll be happy to pee on my grave the general saluted mr president always told myself after leaving the army never stand in line again good job general mcchrystal pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won have to stand in line you re an honorable man we know you wouldn cut in front of others

boom marines send terrorists scathing message video there reason that it called terrorism it because isis and terrorist groups like them use fear and propaganda as means to intimidate people into getting what they want with isis and other islamic terrorists what they want is to force people to convert to islam and live their lives subservient to their muslim rulers anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death isis even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non belief while the notion of being put on terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people hearts marines aren bothered in the slightest they welcome it actually because if the terrorists try to attack the marines then they don have to worry about hunting them down not only are they not intimidated they re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists faces series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that marines are ready for them and it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the united states marine corps things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins book things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now considering how many terrorist attacks the united states has seen over the past year there couldn be better time for the marine corps to send this message to the terrorists liberals were furious over it naturally but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent americans from being able to defend themselves who cares what they think and this message drives stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda remember what they want is to make people afraid these billboards show that not only are the marines not afraid they re ready to take the fight to the terrorists if we re not afraid then the terrorists lose sorry isis game over share this on facebook if you agree with this badass statement

advertisement story continues below the first presidential debate between democrat nominee hillary clinton and republican rival donald trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates as well as several questionable moments nbc lester holt the moderator for the debate started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted trump to fact check him except that his fact checks were more or less wrong in one of the more contentious exchanges holt insisted that trump had supported the iraq war from the beginning but trump continuously denied it usa politics today reported advertisement story continues below rather than ask clinton why she voted for the war holt continued to press trump saying that in an interview with fox news neil cavuto trump expressed his support for the war after the debate was over cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that trump wasn all gung ho about invading iraq before we went in he had his reservations you know what happened to the days of douglas macarthur mean he would go in and attack he wouldn talk mean we have to you know it sort of like either do it or don do it trump said advertisement story continues below well he bush either got to do something or not do something perhaps because perhaps he shouldn be doing it yet perhaps we should be waiting for the united nations you know he under lot of pressure said trump clearly unsure if invading iraq was the right choice you can see it here instead of hammering trump for his alleged support for the iraq war the moderator really should have asked clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than trump did advertisement story continues below it shouldn surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been substantive debate into chance to try to smear trump name luckily trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both clinton and her media pals at the same time share this on facebook and twitter and let us know what you thought of the debate on monday night usa politics today has since pulled their story

well that weird if the birther movement is racist does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for obama what if that person is obama breitbart put this out taken from the ap entitled kenyan born obama all set for us senate that was june kenyan born us senate hopeful barrack obama appeared set to take over the illinois senate seat after his main rival jack ryan dropped out of the race on friday night amid furor over lurid sex club allegations the allegations that horrified fellow republicans and caused his once promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given obama clear lead as republicans struggled to fetch an alternative as far as we know barack obama never refuted this article it still out there on the internet here screen capture here the bottom half of the same article with ap attribution and the link to the original that not actually as weird as the one all the way back in that was obama publicist here the quote breitbart news has obtained promotional booklet produced in by barack obama then literary agency acton dystel which touts obama as born in kenya and raised in indonesia and hawaii the booklet which was distributed to business colleagues in the publishing industry includes brief biography of obama among the biographies of eighty nine other authors represented by acton dystel it also promotes obama anticipated first book journeys in black and white which obama abandoned later publishing dreams from my father instead if obama is contradicting himself the only real question is which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain if his birth in america is valid as we are led to believe why lie about it unless playing the foreigner card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs in which case he is lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of whatever harvard education possibly because if that wasn lie then something else must be that something else being his american birth and citizenship which are prerequisites to his presidency the quote can be read in context at breitbart

on saturday september at pm est an explosion rocked west street in manhattan in the neighborhood commonly referred to as chelsea injuring people smashing windows and initiating street closures there were no fatalities officials maintain that homemade bomb which had been placed in dumpster created the explosion the explosive device was removed by the police at am and was sent to lab in quantico virginia for analysis second device which has been described as pressure cooker device similar to the device used for the boston marathon bombing in was found on west th street between the avenues of the americas and seventh avenue by sunday morning all people had been released from the hospital the chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident saturday morning in seaside heights new jersey where bomb exploded in trash can along route where thousands of runners were present to run marine corps charity race there were no casualties by sunday afternoon law enforcement had learned that the ny and nj explosives were traced to the same person given that we are now living in world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent when bomb goes off our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism after all in the last year alone we have had several significant incidents with massive number of casualties and injuries in paris san bernardino california orlando florida and nice to name few and of course last week we remembered the th anniversary of the september attacks where close to people were killed at the hands of terrorists however we also live in world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self preservation which of course includes identifying the evil doers isn that how crimes are solved law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the bad guys unfortunately our leadership who ostensibly wants to protect us finds their hands and their tongues tied they are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone new york city mayor bill de blasio who famously ended stop and frisk profiling in his city was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the chelsea neighborhood explosion there is no specific and credible threat to new york city from any terror organization de blasio said late saturday at the news conference we believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act want to assure all new yorkers that the nypd and agencies are at full alert he said isn an intentional act terrorism we may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as isis or homegrown terrorist organization or deranged individual or group of individuals it is still terrorism it is not an accident james neill the new york city police commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by natural gas leak at the time the mayor made his comments new york governor andrew cuomo was little more direct than de blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility however he did say that it is question of how the word terrorism is defined bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism cuomo hit the nail on the head but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his obvious assessment the two candidates for president hillary clinton and donald trump also weighed in on the chelsea explosion clinton was very generic in her response saying that we need to do everything we can to support our first responders also to pray for the victims and that we need to let this investigation unfold trump was more direct must tell you that just before got off the plane bomb went off in new york and nobody knows what going on he said but boy we are living in time we better get very tough folks we better get very very tough it terrible thing that going on in our world in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant unfortunately an incident like the chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as soft targets now more than ever america needs strong leadership which is laser focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

less than day after protests over the police killing of an african american man turned violent in north carolina republican presidential nominee donald trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs if you re not aware drugs are very very big factor in what you re watching on television at night said trump in speech to the shale insight conference in pittsburgh today on wednesday night charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of keith lamont scott on tuesday afternoon officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds one person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound the republican nominee condemned the violence calling for unity our country looks bad to the world especially when we are supposed to be the world leader how can we lead when we can even control our own cities we honor and recognize the right of all americans to peacefully assemble protest and demonstrate but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others he continued to praise law enforcement officers citing the challenges they face and calling for better training it tough being police officer trump said police are entrusted with immense responsibility and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always and it will be by them vigorously addressed but aside from that one reference amid his heavy handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against african americans at the hands of police which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets they cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black americans by police as cause to protest system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill african americans in many instances unarmed trump in recent days has appealed to black americans asking them what they have to lose by voting for him even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime during rally earlier this week in north carolina trump said we re going to rebuild our inner cities because our african american communities are absolutely in the worst shape they ve ever been in before ever ever ever many african americans have bristled at that broad assertion while many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty according to census data from percent of black americans age or older hold some sort of college degree pew report released in december shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from to and were the only racial group to see decrease in the percentage of low income earners and according to the census bureau almost percent of black americans do not live in poverty trump in an effort to reach out to the black community visited cleveland earlier this week appearing at black church and during town hall on the fox news channel wednesday night he was asked about the threat of violence would do stop and frisk think you have to said trump we did it in new york it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and you know you really help people sort of change their mind automatically but this morning in an interview on fox friends he stepped back from the statement claiming he was referring to strategy only for chicago in pittsburgh trump delineated difference between what he called the violent disruptor and the rest of the black community he said it was the country job to make life more comfortable for the african american parent trying to raise their kids in peace to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations

obama to un giving up liberty enhances security in america video freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon the problem is liberals hate freedom oh sure they pay lip service to its importance but ultimately they want people to be subservient to liberal controlled government they may not want tyrannical king but tyrannical government of socialist loving politicians pushing government controlled everything is ok with them they can ever say this out loud though which makes the speech obama just gave to the united nations rather surprising obama actually admitted that he thinks it necessary for the united states to give up little liberty you know for safety tuesday obama spoke to the united nations general assembly we can only realize the promise of this institution founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints he said sometimes am criticized in my own country for professing belief in international norms and multilateral institutions but am convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long term enhances our security things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkins book things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now so evidently obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us how this will make the country safer he didn explain but safety relies on us bringing more muslim refugees into the united states ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees obama said obama may want to take look at how germany is doing accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer it made it more dangerous and right here in the united states we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year how allowing over muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that obama can actually explain because it completely ludicrous idea and turning the united states into country that has to answer to the united nations before we act on anything doesn make us safer either it typical liberal idea something that is nonsensical and useless yet will weaken the country and strip americans of their protected rights but hey who needs freedom right obama has an agenda to push

to help american workers trump responded in his usual way saying america was getting beaten by everyone else around the world and the nafta free trade deal was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs hillary clinton by contrast sees the world as place where all boats can rise at once as she also made plain monday by harking back to bill clinton pro globalization presidency which included nafta think my husband did pretty good job in the think lot about what worked and how we can make it work again she said incomes went up for everybody story continued below that is the election of distilled down to its essence my whole life is about winning always win trump says in explaining why he running the economic plan on his website begins with the rubric winning the global competition you don get more zero sum than that despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not zero sum game but rather complex mechanism that if run right can raise everyone welfare at once trump message has resonated in an era when it become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy the zero sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades as danny vinik recently noted in politico the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow the recent census report that showed percent increase in real median income between and was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an america in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed statistically if the united states is one unit that is true but million people have huge variety of experiences ill suited to one size fit all numbers and while the averages and medians may go up or down that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number and the experience of goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid housing bubble is unequivocally negative insecure and economically grim hence you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the democrats while those who think they ve lost are going toward trump there is some truth there but that isn sufficient explanation for why for instance massive percentages of african americans and latinos who have certainly struggled economically and socially support clinton no what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero sum terms like trump and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of winners without creating commensurate number of losers that has been the mantra of clinton and her predecessors in the democratic party and it was also the foundation of ronald reagan appeal the belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier hillary clinton has continued to deliver that message at the democratic convention in july she spoke of an america thriving with economic opportunity with millions working hard and succeeding president obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of silicon valley the revival of many cities in the past decade and the substantial gains on the other side of financial crisis judging from polls and surveys those who fit that description clustered and concentrated in large metro areas and on the coasts especially support clinton and the democrats by wide margins is either side right most economists see the liberal order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as key element to the emergence of several billion strong global middle class in general that view is correct but it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the united states caught in the vortex of rapid change it does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents they legitimately fear that they will lose those homes be unable to afford healthcare that they will see their communities crumble and their children hopes extinguished and they see world of others who appear to be doing better who seem to be winning and political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing the voice of the so called losers in this global competition is as loud politically speaking as it been in long time hence trump not to mention bernie sanders powerful insurgency in the democratic primaries the last time so many in the united states were so sour about the inequities between those winning the few and those losing was at the dawn of the progressive movement in the many early progressives rebelled against an elite vision of social darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can in the scion of that view was william jennings bryan who painted picture of the united states every bit as bleak and dark as trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on cross of gold bryan lost two elections and his zero sum view never came to dominate american politics much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system however was taken up by theodore roosevelt and generations of both republicans and democrats some of it harsh and redistributive focused on trust busting and exerting american influence and prestige abroad and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all trump also enjoys good deal of sub rosa support among business leaders and wall street who certainly haven lack for economic benefits in today world they aren supporting him with their money but many of them detest clinton and see trump as expressing their world view for wall street that makes some sense in that in the wake of the financial crisis key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable in that sense finance which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid through the mid has been losing ground the idea of gain and loss and that every trade represents winner and loser is deeply embedded in aspects of wall street we have of course no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks but if trump wins he should remember it is impossible to find any society and any point in american history where zero sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security zero sum most often begets zero sum whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars by contrast the profound strength of the united states has been vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers and little else zachary karabell is head of

president obama today vetoed bill that would allow survivors of the attacks along with victims families to sue the government of saudi arabia am returning herewith without my approval the justice against sponsors of terrorism act jasta which would among other things remove sovereign immunity in courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism obama notes in the veto message have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of september who have suffered grievously also have deep appreciation of these families desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts the veto comes at the end of day constitutional window after congress overwhelming approval of the legislation setting up fight that likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant especially considering the president high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency by comparison former president george bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted the last president to make it through full presidency without veto override is lyndon johnson if passed into law the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages obama and the white house have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of sovereign immunity and put the government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries overriding the president veto means that this country will start pursuing less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world white house press secretary josh earnest explained to reporters today our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with saudi arabia but rather the impact that this could have on the united states relationship with countries around the world but the showdown has also put the obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless families who argue they haven had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks saudi arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort maintaining it had no role in assisting the terrorists the house and senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent veto override requires two thirds vote by each chamber and the white house says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough democrats to block the override effort obama former secretary of state hillary clinton has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election

hillary clinton and donald trump ushered the presidential campaign into new phase tonight and they did it with plenty of barbs the two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at hofstra university in long island new york in front of what was expected to be historic number of television viewers here are moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate nominees started off on friendly note but no escaping the sarcasm hillary clinton and donald trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on genteel note although the mutual contempt was just below the surface when clinton walked out in red pantsuit and trump in blue tie the opponents trading traditional party colors the two shook hands and clinton said how are you donald perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with warm greeting shortly after the debate began trump talked about overseas trade deals saying but in all fairness to secretary clinton before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying yes is that ok good want you to be very happy it very important to me he seemed to be referring to his addressing her as secretary clinton although it wasn completely clear during the moment personal attacks came early clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight debate taking aim at trump business roots by claiming he borrowed million from his father to start his real estate business donald was very fortunate in his life and that all to his benefit he started his business with million borrowed from his father and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people the better off we ll be and that everything will work out from there don buy that have different experience clinton said before expanding on her father work as drapery maker trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in trumped up trickle down economics for one thing and before we start on that my father gave me very small loan in and built it into company that worth many many billions of dollars trump said trading barbs over trade voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the trans pacific partnership trade deal trump accused clinton of supporting tpp the proposed trade agreement between the united states and other countries along the pacific rim and now you want to approve trans pacific partnership you were totally in favor of it trump said clinton fired back well that is just not accurate was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out trump then pointed to clinton once referring to tpp as the gold standard of trade deals well donald know you live in your own reality but that is not the facts clinton said clinton promoted tpp as secretary of state under president obama who is pushing the trade deal while speaking in australia in november clinton said tpp sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free transparent fair trade the kind of environment that has the rule of law and level playing field clinton came out against the trade deal october of last year saying that what know about it as of today am not in favor of what have learned about it trump asks why not blame all the world problems on clinton less than minutes into the debate trump went after clinton attacking her on trade isis taxes the economy and more clinton quipped have feeling by the end of this evening going to be blamed for everything that ever happened trump didn miss beat saying to his opponent why not clinton responded why not yeah why not just join the debate by saying more crazy things now let me say this trump interjected there nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country before the moderator reminded trump this is secretary clinton two minutes please drew angerer getty images trump hit over not releasing tax returns trump clashed with his democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns don mind releasing under routine audit and it will be released he said trump went on to tout his disclosure of different federally mandated form required by the office of government ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general trump then pivoted to attack clinton over her private email server will release my tax returns against my lawyer wishes when she releases her mails that have been deleted he said think you ve just seen another example of bait and switch here for years everyone running for president has release their tax returns she said you got to ask yourself why won he release his tax returns maybe he doesn want the american people all of you watching tonight to know that he paid nothing in federal taxes she said the birther issue gets on the main stage moderator lester holt asked trump what took you so long to acknowledge that president obama was born in the united states bringing the republican nominee recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years at first trump claimed that two clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into barack obama birth certificate during the campaign claim that he has made before and then said that he was satisfied with when obama released his birth certificate holt noted that obama released his longform birth certificate in but trump continued to raise questions about it authenticity until nobody was pressing it nobody was caring much about it trump said referencing the years between the release and trump decision this month to acknowledge obama was born in america figured you ask the question tonight of course but nobody was caring much about it but was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate and think did good job paul richards afp getty images clinton defends being prepared when trump questions her time off the trail trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said ve been all over the place you decided to stay home and that ok seeming to jab clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight faceoff think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate clinton said and yes did and you know what else prepared for prepared to be president and think that good thing throughout the debate clinton tried to portray trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency she also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail that she doesn stump as much as he does because she doesn have his endurance stop and frisk becomes big point of discussion trump support of stop and frisk controversial tactic once heavily used by the new york police department was discussed at length during the debate stop and frisk had tremendous impact on the safety of new york city tremendous beyond belief so when you say it has no impact it really did it had very very big impact trump said trump said that the tactic was not deemed which it was and added instead that it went before judge who was very against police judge they would have won an appeal he said noting that there was no appeal trump and clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like chicago and new york for nearly minutes of the debate trump and the iraq war under the microscope toward the end of the debate holt corrected trump on whether he supported the war in iraq before it started did not support the war in iraq trump said that is mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media holt corrected him saying the record shows otherwise the only time trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to howard stern in and seemed to support the invasion stern asked trump are you for invading iraq trump appeared to hesitate responding yeah guess so wish the first time it was done correctly despite the attempt to correct him trump continued to stress he was against the war saying the record shows that am right sparring over stamina holt asked trump about when he once said that clinton does not have presidential look asking trump what he meant by that trump pivoted to attack her stamina she doesn have the look she doesn have the stamina trump said said she doesn have the stamina and don believe she does have the stamina to be president of this country you need tremendous stamina trump has been hitting clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months but tonight clinton tried to shut that line of attack down well as soon as he travels to countries and negotiates peace deal cease fire release of dissidents an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world or even spends hours testifying in front of congressional committee he can talk to me about stamina clinton said she also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women one thing lester he tried to switch from looks to stamina clinton said but this is man who has called women pigs slobs and dogs and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers who has said women don deserve equal pay unless they do as good job as men

jeb bush to lecture at harvard this fall
hillary clinton campaign is making one plea ahead of monday night big debate don let donald trump get away with it and trump campaign is firing right back arguing that the press is biased against the republican nominee and in any case clinton team is just trying to game the refs story continued below the debate is playing out against backdrop of polls that indicate tightening white house race with trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground state surveys polling averages now show that clinton post convention lead has evaporated and no less guru than nate silver declared on monday morning that the race is dead heat the latest polling is consistent with clinton lead of only nationally state firewall breaking up trend lines awful silver tweeted during the critical hours of expectation setting ahead of the showdown at hofstra university both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard with clinton aides explicitly requesting that moderator lester holt fact check trump in real time we are concerned that donald trump may lie he may throw misinformation out there and that hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish clinton campaign manager robby mook told cbs this morning adding that all the campaign is asking of holt is that if trump lies that that simply be checked the thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves who have been selected by the commission because they will be seen as fair and even handed what bothers us mark is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs trump campaign manager kellyanne conway shot back in an interview on msnbc but conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending trump claim that holt may be unfair to him because he democrat and the system is very unfair the nbc nightly news anchor has been registered republican in new york since don know that he knew what lester holt voter registration was said conway who went on to dodge multiple queries of why trump lied he didn lie conway said at one point explaining that lie would mean that he knew the man party registration in presidential cycle that seen endless debates about debates monday theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be moderator after suggesting debate with no moderator trump has already signaled to holt that he shouldn try to be candy crowley who famously injected herself into the presidential debate between president barack obama and mitt romney with fact check of the gop nominee but clinton campaign has beat up on holt nbc colleague matt lauer who was widely panned in the media for allowing trump false assertion that he didn support the iraq war go unchecked during national security forum earlier this month view one week of hillary clinton fact checks september one week of hillary clinton fact checks september the nonpartisan commission on presidential debates which selected the debate sites and moderators weighed in sunday in our history the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said janet brown the commission executive director told cnn reliable sources when it comes to fact checking brown warned don think it good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the encyclopedia britannica for her part clinton won let trump lies go by the wayside press secretary brian fallon told cnn on monday insisting that holt shouldn either there is enough lies that donald trump tells consistently that everyone by now should be able to call them out he said lester holt hillary clinton will too but think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates performances should take it into account by now we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the iraq war he lies about his support for the intervention in libya he lies about who started birtherism he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now if he says them again that should be disqualifying he can possibly be given passing grade if he repeats those lies former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski paid cnn contributor who is still receiving severance from the trump campaign dismissed the idea that fact checking moderator is of any concern think what the concern is from both of the campaigns and what it should be is that the moderator is not the person who running for president of the united states so think you let the candidates debate you let the candidates answer he said you can hold people accountable there no question but don think it the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate trump campaign including his former aide lewandowski also pushed the narrative that clinton is robotic that charge was leveled in response to the clinton camp preparation for two trumps we don want donald trump lies and distortions to be distraction we re hoping that can get checked so that hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do mook told nbc today asked about clinton rules of engagement versus trump mook added that it just depends on what donald trump shows up to the debate and we just don know that view one week of donald trump fact checks september one week of donald trump fact checks september but conway shot down the notion that there any other trump while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion lewandowski cast clinton as policy wonk whose challenge is to become human during the debate senior communications adviser jason miller tweeted that overprogramming leads to short circuits and conway joined the pile on he not going to be robotic and scripted hillary clinton is conway said and that problem in debates likes this because people want to see future commander in chief and president of the united states who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven been pre programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates after mook warned against double standard where donald trump can get the most improved award but hillary clinton you know is getting judged on the fine points of policy conway added that the two campaign managers are living in parallel universes mean donald trump has been criticized all weekend long think that the clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs has been talking to the media for week now saying it your job to make sure that donald trump is fact checked in real time she said just surprised campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate but look they know that campaign debates are not hillary clinton sweet spot yes she experienced at doing them but the experience hasn necessarily been beneficial aside from how holt will moderate conway cited pre written narratives and what she claimed was clinton willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns worried that some of the headlines are already written that they re conclusions in search of evidence conway said adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut trump ahead of the debate what would ask you all to do is start looking at the twitter feeds of quote objective reporters particularly our embeds these are not profiles in courage and this is not journalism there are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on twitter conway said ninety two percent of at least two of our embeds tweets are negative towards donald trump why are they on our campaign plane why are they covering our campaign excuse the trump campaign if we feel like we can get fair shake from certain people conway also indicated that clinton may play the woman card skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul performance so if she ends up saying to him that just not true you re distorting my record you re being mean to woman and then people will say he was mean to woman and the headlines will scream and twitter will blow up even if it not true she said so that would be my concern that he not able to get out all of his responses because as joe scarborough correctly points out people are so worried that she not great debater that she not really ready for tonight the way he is that she going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such way that he was somehow rude to woman and he somehow lied on the stage rudy giuliani the former new york mayor and prominent trump surrogate said he had advised trump to just let loose and be himself and not try to compete with clinton detailed policy expertise she been in government since was child don remember time she hasn been in government in one way or another giuliani said on fox and friends so she going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has but think he going to comport himself very very well and he going to be he just going to be like you see him on when he comes here on fox news and when you talk to him on the phone he going to be donald trump authors
clinton vs trump the debate before the debate
ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast including the little remembered john kennedy hubert humphrey contest just before the west virginia primary and for nearly years ve analyzed how candidates win and lose them but when ask myself what kind of strategy would devise for hillary clinton tonight against donald trump pretty much baffled the problem is not just the unpredictable to put it mildly nature of her opponent will trump be low key and calm will he attack her honesty will he turn on lester holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage the problem is that almost all of hillary clinton strengths in this strange election year can so easily be turned into her weaknesses especially her vast experience in government the more she emphasizes her qualifications the more trump is likely to respond with some version of you ve been at the center of power for years then you re one of those who created the mess we re in so reciting her work with foreign leaders for example and contrasting it with trump utter lack of grounding in the world doesn seem to be promising story continued below indeed this debate offers trump the chance to perform what ve called political judo turning an opponent strength against her yes mrs clinton your experience helped drag us into iraq and turned syria libya the whole middle east into staging ground for isis maybe that why your husband cia director and bobby kennedy chief speechwriter are backing me further there sense highly limited sense in which trump is in something like the position ronald reagan was in back in among college educated whites who have resisted him so far his task is to use the debates to say reasonable person who knows what gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it it second cousin of the situation where many voters did not want carter but needed reassurance about reagan which they got there is limit to this analogy because for all of her difficulties clinton is in much stronger position than president carter was by contrast how does she try to gain strength on the issue of honest and trustworthy if trump can be convinced by his handlers assuming they exist to avoid overkill here all he has to do is to note what the fbi director or the new york times editorial page has said she can of course cite chapter and verse on trump bankruptcies trump university david farenthold expose of his charities in the washington post but those issues are ill suited think to face to face debate one of her problems longstanding is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at trump and he still standing does any of this mean that clinton is facing doom monday night no it does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don do based on half century or so of history the focus is on moments but they re not always the key ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates and it would go something like this nixon looked pale and drawn ford prematurely liberated poland from soviet control reagan said to carter there you go again then asked americans are you better off four years later he was incoherent but then recovered by joking about mondale youth and inexperience dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife rape and murder lloyd bentsen told dan quayle was no jack kennedy george bush looked at his watch al gore stalked george bush who froze him with nod these are the moments that are played over and over again in the run up to debates they illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip the gaffe the thrust the parry that can sum up minutes it why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy memorable lines zingers to win the attention and admiration of the audience it also why the late political journalist lars erik nelson scornfully said of his colleagues you ve all become theater critics but in fact this view of debates is not the whole story sometimes it the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails look back at the first romney obama debate in there was no one exchange no one obama stumble or romney answer that provided the aha moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox it was rather obama petulant defensive sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten the presence of trump clearly raises the odds that we may see moment unlike any in debate history that clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for but it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and half that will persuade viewer to say he seemed pretty reasonable or she knows what she talking about and he doesn this has special relevance for clinton who as her longtime friend and one time aide patti solis doyle observed always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth sustained relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against trump whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to teleprompter is questionable there are three debates not one and that can matter whole lot one key reason why the reagan carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two carter had refused to debate with third party candidate john anderson so reagan faced off against anderson on september st when the independent fell below the polling threshold carter and reagan met for the first and last time on october th barely week before the election every other time there have been three debates which has meant there is chance to make up for less than successful debut that what happened with reagan in and with george bush in it also what happened last time out when obama emerged from his daze and outperformed romney in their two other meetings here think is an opening for clinton especially in the town hall meetings where she should be able to turn question and they are usually very lame what can you do for my daughter questions into answers that fuse personal concern with command both of her proposals and of trump astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next the danger for her is channeling her inner al gore who challenged bush commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding what about dingell norwood the opportunity for her is to argue from experience that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better further the town meeting format with dozens of real people as participants makes the resort to personal insults highly risky trump is not the only one who can deploy political judo the potential for trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo it came in when independent ross perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience well he said they ve got point don have any experience in running up trillion debt don have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else don have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world the most violent crime ridden society in the industrialized world judo however can cut both ways there clear opening for clinton if trump were to boast of his leadership skills and his business success well you might be successful donald but we really don know because you re the first presidential candidate ever who won show us his taxes but you know you should look at the business leaders who support me mike bloomberg who worth four times what you claim to be worth and who didn start with millions from his father says you re con fake so does marc cuban who built his success from the ground up but do have to admit you re way way ahead of them in unpaid workers fleeced contractors and lawsuits debates are not decisive one last note it easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake monday night lot of post election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story reagan recovered from his first debate gaffe and went onto win landslide obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re elected but is correlation really causation maybe the economic boom of has lot more to do with reagan winning states maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in obama clear if modest popular vote victory in their influential book the gamble political scientists john sides and lynn vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates gaffes and other game changers with real time public opinion measurements what they found was that even dramatic event like romney first debate performance had relative small and relatively short lived impact compared to the fundamentals economic performance and the ever growing impact of polarized electorate the stuff of which hundred overwrought post debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance of course this cycle the fundamentals point to very close race so you ll probably want to tune in anyway jeff greenfield is five time emmy winning network television analyst and

was democrat all my life came to washington to serve president john kennedy and attorney general robert kennedy when the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own joined his senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination ran on losing democratic ticket in the new york state elections of when was working to enact my own program of police reform in the and then governor bill clinton was chairman of my national committee for the police corps this year will vote to elect donald trump as president of the united states story continued below so profound change and decent respect for old friendships requires me to deliver public accounting for this decision here it is john and robert kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace to them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life but today democrats have become the party of war home for arms merchants mercenaries academic war planners lobbyists for every foreign intervention promoters of color revolutions failed generals exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments we have american military bases in countries and there are now american military personnel on the ground in about countries remarkable achievement since there are only recognized countries generals and admirals announce our national policies theater commanders are our principal ambassadors our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be military movement or action nor has the democratic party candidate for president this year hillary clinton sought peace instead she has pushed america into successive invasions successive efforts at regime change she has sought to prevent americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with president vladimir putin of russia by characterizing him as another hitler she proclaims herself ready to invade syria immediately after taking the oath of office her shadow war cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades the neocons who led us to our present pass in iraq in afghanistan syria libya yemen in ukraine unrepentant of all past errors ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood and the democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with russia for example by sending american warships into the black sea or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to russia itself in fact in all the years of the so called war on terror only one potential american president has had the intelligence the vision the sheer sanity to see that america cannot fight the entire world at once who sees that america natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it only one american candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with russia and china at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking that candidate is donald trump throughout this campaign he has said that as president he would quickly sit down with president putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists on this ground alone he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors earlier in the primaries and now in the general election it must also be said mr trump is an imperfect candidate and he would surely be an imperfect president he is crude often vulgar he has areas of great ignorance he insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm he would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words he is often intemperate though it is not trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare putin moves in ukraine to what hitler did an insult that throughout all the cold war and to this day no american president has ever offered to any soviet or russian leader not even the enormous butcher josef stalin with whom in fact we joined to win the second world war and it is not mr trump but michael morell former cia director now high in the councils of the democratic candidate who has publicly suggested without rebuke from anyone that we should begin killing russians doubly illegal act of war moreover trump marks himself as man of singular political courage willing to defy the hysteria of the washington war hawks the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti american for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one note devotion to war john kennedy admired political courage he began his first campaign for congress at the height of the cold war by saying above all day and night with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess we must work for peace we must not have another war years later in the cuban missile crisis of he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders government officials and other public leaders to prevent war with the soviet union there were men in the excomm room and robert kennedy said that had any of of them been president the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war but within year thereafter deeply affected by the barely averted catastrophe president kennedy had forged close working relationship with soviet leader nikita khrushchev spoke all over the country to promote peace policies and delivered his historic american university speech of our strategy of peace he said was not pax americana enforced on the world by american weapons of war rather it must be founded on negotiation cooperation in areas of mutual interest and recognition that our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet we all breathe the same air we all cherish our children future and we are all mortal as to our great adversary the soviet union he said we must reexamine our own attitude as individuals and as nation for our attitude is as essential as theirs six months later he was dead and it was robert kennedy who must resume the effort robert kennedy made ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty the early centerpiece of his senate career but as president lyndon johnson escalated the war in vietnam it was that war which forced robert kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency wherever he campaigned in to virtually every audience he spoke of the loss the horror the infinite tragedy of that war in words that could be and must be repeated today after consecutive years of wars all over the world our brave young men he said are dying in the swamps of southeast asia which of them might have written poem which of them might have cured cancer which of them might have played in world series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build bridge or university which of them would have taught child to read it is our responsibility to let these men live it is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country he also urged that we consider the vietnamese mother desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky sent by machines from country she could barely understand he demanded of his colleagues on the senate floor to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world to arrogate to ourselves the power of god the rule of life and death over others all this is our responsibility he said not just nation responsibility but yours and mine john and robert kennedy were no pacifists nor ignorant of the realities of power but they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint and with humility both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death the legacy of jfk rfk is being abandoned by today democratic party theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today democratic party we have broken one middle eastern nation after another hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins hundreds of thousands are dead millions are refugees and for all the press and political thundering against the menace of isis al qaeda or islamic terrorism generally our military leaders offer no prospects of victory they cannot tell us what victory would require or mean though they are quick to assure us as in libya today that this conflict will go on indefinitely they cannot even explain how some of our current allies example turkey are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies example the kurds so democratic administration carrying on the work of the bush presidency without thought and without question year after year has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder scores of democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in vietnam today there is only the voice of the marvelous democratic member of congress tulsi gabbard reservist who has twice deployed to iraq and knows of what she speaks and it is democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world flaunting for all to see america unique military technology coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations most amazing of all however is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten europe threaten the united states threaten western civilization itself as we face all this we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat where are we sending our warriors our ships our planes why to russia which the general who commands nato has announced is the prime existential threat to america as you read this ground air and naval forces of nato led and largely paid for by the united states have been moving about the western borders of russia carrying out the largest military maneuvers since world war ii at the same time our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the south china sea there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of china our second said to be existential enemy there are no russian terrorists ravaging france or italy or america isis is not to be found on russian soil the only russian terrorists who have attacked the west are the islamists whom president putin first asked us to join in the fight against in the only chinese terrorists are uighurs who are attacking not us but china itself it would seem elementary common sense that america would have long since sought not to fight with russia and china but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over generation including the isis that is terrorizing europe today former defense secretary william perry democrat warns that we are now today on the threshold of new cold war new nuclear arms race the likelihood of nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the cold war surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire and our empire as every thoughtful person knows is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by america by our governments our corporations our households our students and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future the years of constant combat have exhausted our military false hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars generation ago our forces are worn out especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than decade but ominously there is more to come more that already stares us in the face the dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home this is not danger imported from syria or iraq or russia our greatest menace is the danger of our own history our inheritance to the latest day for the fact is that while we chased chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings we were neglecting our own country and our own people our own neighbors our own children and our own friends and now we can see the result the violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own the money we squandered on bombs in iraq was not available for our own schools the brilliant young men and women who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto they were not here to police the mean streets to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty they were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the american constitution to the least among us they were not here to protect american cities and enrich american lives and they were not here to keep americans and american children from murdering american police officers this is our true present danger so my hope for america is this first we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless unnecessary and therefore murderous wars we need our best young people to help us here at home we need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments we need to breathe free again we must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies isis and its brethren must be eliminated no quarter no hesitation but we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense we must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies we must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations especially russia and china president kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security in this dangerous world would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with russia and the russian people indeed at the end of his presidency ronald reagan said the same fools in washington intent on world domination would have us ignore that wisdom now but it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children future second we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace there are many ills to be cured many shortcomings to be righted but nothing can be accomplished in the midst of war against police an insurrection against the constitution itself our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments we need many more and better police we need them to be better trained not as warriors but as shepherds as leaders and teachers of the young as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years we need our very best young people not getting their legs blown off by ieds in afghanistan but saving all of our lives in st louis and chicago and detroit and baton rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land donald trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying america first but to demand that all the actions of government at home or abroad be first directed at the interests and well being of our own country is not old fashioned or outmoded rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of american statesmen from the founders on only with clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens and full commitment to those interests can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond finally our president has told us we must lower our voices of course we do not hope for domestic discord but the people of the united states have perhaps stood silent for too long the elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction from the heights of their power and eminence these are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster this president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems and when we ask who will be the target for these world destroying weapons says only there can be no business as usual with russia surely he must have misspoken for anyone can see we are on course of madness we simply cannot fight the entire world russia and china and all the nations of the mideast and fight war at home all at the same time and therefore we citizens must not be silent we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice voice as powerful as washington as jefferson as lincoln as martin luther king return to the wisdom of the founders who fought necessary wars to defend the union but sought no foreign conquests do not step over the threshold of new cold war new nuclear arms race with russia and china but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization commit to our own domestic peace and security rather than persist in vain effort to control the lives and affairs of foreign nations this as understand it is the platform of donald trump it was not the republican party platform and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination but it is his platform it is the platform he has restated again and again with determination and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics it is platform that even in these troubled days could fulfill the hopes of the greatest americans of all parties well may we seek reassurance whether mr trump has the kind of cool judgment and self possession that the presidency requires the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis that saves nation or perhaps world no one can ever truly know how future president will react to such enormous pressures but trump has given some evidence he set himself unique course toward the office disdaining conventional wisdom speaking more truth about politics and about america than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise and yet it is his independence his willingness to name facts however unpleasant together with his great political courage that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job perhaps most important he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets to the immense loss of both flawed as he may be trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day most important he offers path away from constant war path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization thus to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace life and death for our people and our country you and will have to compensate for his deficits of civility in return for peace we may hope as lincoln hoped among ourselves and with all nations truly america first last and always for ourselves and for our posterity these are the reasons why will vote for donald trump for president adam walinsky worked in the department of justice during the kennedy administration and later served as legislative assistant and speechwriter to sen robert kennedy
was rfk speechwriter now voting for trump here why

united nations cnn president barack obama made an impassioned plea tuesday for countries to fulfill moral obligation to alleviate global refugee crisis of epic proportions despite political backlash in the us against absorbing those fleeing middle east violence the president interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world and pushing back against the anti refugee tenor was underscored by his decision to convene leaders summit on refugees at the united nations tuesday at the summit he also rejected another aspect of the american political debate swirling around accepting foreigners gop presidential nominee donald trump call to build wall along the us mexico border this crisis is test of our common humanity whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls or whether we see ourselves in another obama said though he didn mention trump by name obama singled out the situation in syria which has displaced million people so far as particularly unacceptable just watched president obama at the un then and now replay more videos must watch president obama at the un then and now we are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop he said describing the global refugee crisis as both humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries ability to take collective action called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time he said just as failure to act in the past for example by turning away jews fleeing nazi germany is stain on our collective conscience believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment the refugee issue is one that captured the world attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since world war ii seared into the public consciousness by photos like that of year old syrian boy who drowned in the mediterranean and the flood of migrants into europe recent study by from the un refugee agency estimated million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in up by over five million from the prior year many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries but about million are classified as refugees obama summit follows similar un led meeting on the issue monday which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments make no mistake us secretary of state john kerry said at the un meeting additional efforts are urgently needed leaders also called for more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows acknowledging the burden is shouldered by certain regions you have to know that today the european union has clear objective to restore order on its external borders european council president donald tusk said in his remarks signaling growing sense that patience in europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin there will be no repeat of the year with more than one and half million irregular migrants he added the obama administration is hopeful the leader summit on tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action national security advisor susan rice in june announced that the gathering co hosted along with the us by canada ethiopia germany jordan mexico sweden and the un secretary general would seek an increase in funding of at least doubling of permanent resettlement and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging yet the level of need demands no less rice said in statement but aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed we have to be optimistic that we ll see some real concrete commitments said amnesty international interim executive director margaret huang but the truth is even if those numbers are hit it nowhere near what actually needed the us is major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees particularly syria neighbors and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to america from in to next year the president chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action it is limited in what it can do the president commitment to ensuring that the united states plays leading role on this issue is not shared by lot of people in congress including by lot of people in the republican majority in congress press secretary josh earnest told reporters and that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort vetting efforts to screen refugees he noted are not cheap david miliband president of the international rescue committee and former british foreign secretary said he hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action the scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response miliband told cnn governments around the world haven in the main been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now but the co hosts of the leaders summit said in statement they were pleased with new and significant humanitarian contributions from world leaders we sought billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years they said through our mutual efforts over the course of the donors participating today have contributed this year roughly billion additional dollars to un appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in as they await action from world leaders in new york group of volunteers in london laid out life jacket graveyard monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who ve lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the mediterranean the conflict in syria and resulting migrant crisis in the middle east and europe have dominated headlines over the past months but refugees are global problem perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so called global south the developing countries of the southern hemisphere last week south sudan joined the ranks of syria afghanistan and somalia countries with over million of their citizens living as refugees abroad and protracted conflict in places like somalia have led to generation of lifelong refugees men and women in their twenties who ve never known life outside of camp these are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries huang said

story highlights donald trump criticized hillary clinton for her approach to national security issues it recurring theme of his campaign estero florida cnn donald trump speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on us soil sought to paint his rival hillary clinton as weak and ineffective leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical islamic terrorism as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions the republican presidential nominee addressing more than people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in new york and new jersey talked up his hardline immigration policies argued domestic terror suspects even us citizens should be tried as foreign enemy combatants rather than receive due process under us law he also slammed clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on islamist terrorism hillary clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical islamic terrorists trump said pointing to clinton comments that half his supporters belong in basket of deplorables has she ever talked that way about radical islam no trump said are those words reserved only for hard working americans who truly love our country and they want to make statement one can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking americans are somehow greater threat to our country than these islamic extremists read more

getty images fourth estate in defense of he said she said journalism why we must give the devil his due the he said she said method of reporting in which journalists observe the profession convention and get at least two sides of every story has been taking it on the chin ever since new york university journalism professor jay rosen placed it in his gunsights in and started ack acking it with regularity but the he said she said debate didn move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the new york times abandoned mechanical balance and published page one above the fold piece by michael barbaro shredding donald trump as pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest birther declaration the times piece elated critics of the he said she said construct in an atlantic piece titled the death of he said she said journalism peter beinart pronounced barbaro work journalistic sea change trump had broken all the rules of political conduct beinart stated and the times had rightly ditched few of its own abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing falsehood when what they re actually doing is lying the times piece dealt with trump with astonishing bluntness beinart wrote repeatedly calling trump birther nonsense lie trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges which sits just fine with the he said she said critics story continued below while consider trump to be first rate liar and don mind saying so not convinced that jettisoning the he said she said blueprint is such good idea every politician lies if we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way barbaro did trump it would be entertaining but political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances isn that what the fact checker columns are for in his widely applauded critiques of he said she said journalism rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the other side of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth the media creates bogus symmetry between the he said voices in story and the prevaricators serving up the she said dissent do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who faking it more rosen asked proposing that journalists put higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion the he said she said structure constitutes one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence he would later remark donald trump the thinking goes has gamed the he said she said convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies obfuscations and double talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue clarification of something he said or response to point raised by his opponent hillary clinton this is true in speeches and interviews he expressed broadband stream of lies such as denying that he used terms like fat pig to describe women insisting that he never called george bush liar claiming that he opposed the iraq war making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy asserting that the nfl had contacted him about the debate schedule and more much more but they are lies all lies and every time the media quotes one of trump she said lies without correcting fact check it undermines the truth of the he said side of the debate at least so the thinking goes but has journalists practice of giving trump the right of reply allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such disaster one result of the straight he said she said coverage of the trump style has been his record lows in the washington post abc news favorability poll thanks to this coverage many voters are able to see through trump post truth style of politics and don need the news pages directly calling him lying liar who lies every time he speaks among his supporters many don care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster campaign he waging for the presidency he serving baloney and his supporters can get enough of it as bracing and as full of truth telling as the barbaro piece was hope it doesn embolden other news pages to abandon convention the formula when properly executed forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles the form is even more useful for skeptical show me readers who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about candidate or an issue this realize can be especially challenging with trump because the mouth of manhattan has made career of taking both sides on nearly everything he is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers both he said and she said and like any good circus freak that makes him too exceptional to build rules from one reason admire he said she said journalism is that often find myself sympathizing with the she said side of the equation and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry whenever the she said component of story goes missing leaving only the dominant position expressed get the feeling being fed bunk even the holy bible gives satan forum for his dastardly views so why not news stories don believe story must balance out like chemistry equation until both sides or multiple sides hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium but intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field ruling paradigms if you don mind the language have tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques in order for thought to progress the minority report however seemingly misguided must be heard the history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she saiders early in the last century for example the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics which held that was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just to oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus to define yourself as crackpot to be reduced to she said if you were lucky enough to get quoted in news story today we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes or consider the story of alfred wegener he he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift not until the did his ideas gain proper respect and his critics take his place as geology crackpots or take the example of australian doctor barry marshall who conjectured in the early that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers condition that afflicted up to percent of all adults even after marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking potion containing helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment you think it science it got to be accepted marshall told discover magazine but it not an absolute given by the mid the idea finally took root undermining the business model of thousands of who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery in marshall and colleague were awarded the nobel prize in medicine for their helicobacter pylori work science abounds with equally dramatic stories obviously the critiques of every she saider don automatically end in the triumphs wegener and marshall enjoyed but when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis the one size fits all advice on mammograms has been abandoned our views on saturated fat once almost holy writ have been chucked until the american psychiatric association classified homosexuality as mental disorder all is not progress some now argue that homophobia is an indicator of disorder marijuana makes you mad today the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you coffee once thought to be bad for you turns out to be good for you at least for now moving over to the policy realm the once dominant super predator thesis was once supported across partisan lines it is now discredited remember how japan economy was supposed to overtake the united states remember how federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan said the economic system was stable experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide and so on the dissents of the she saiders are generally beneficial whether right or wrong the dissenters have way of increasing everybody knowledge if they are wrong as michael shermer has written their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self examine and if warranted use new evidence to improve its position if the she saiders are right they advance human thought that how science works and believe journalism should work that way too vaccine pioneer jonas salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee jerk paradigm defenders with this progression first salk writes they say that it can be true second phase well if it true it not very important third phase well we ve known it all along before anybody puts words in my mouth this is not my long winded way of saying don subscribe to the global warming hypothesis do but at the same time keep my options open the protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers even against crackpots the last and best reason for supporting he said she said journalism so many readers and viewers have self segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views these days many readers get only the he said side of the story or just the she said side remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on while value partisan media also value nonpartisan news operations like politico that make ideas duel in their news pages npr news director michael oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars you present the facts calmly and without tone of editorializing you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts that is why the tone of journalism matters so much we need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly and not to confirm our opinions if you re not getting steady diet of she said quotations in your news consumption you re at risk of starving to death he said she said keeps journalists honest even if on occasion it looks like it only accruing to the benefit of beast like donald trump sumptuous meal of news news news make mine

donald trump has reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests he is known for willingness to spout off to whoever sticks microphone in front of his face and it has helped him get this far as political candidate but lately as trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel he has also been in something of retreat that is trump is only talking to fox news right now trump is saying yes to fox news almost every day but saying no to most other major networks and news organizations highly unusual strategy for presidential nominee he called into fox friends on monday morning he is booked on the reilly factor monday night and he has another town hall with sean hannity coming up on wednesday rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for trump if nothing else it limits the candidate exposure to hard hitting questions while fueling frustration among journalists at fox news trump can avoid pesky follow up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy long after he claims to have dropped it fox news hosts won ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement at fox news trump isn challenged and that the way he wants it the problem is wrapping up in the fox news cocoon may feel good for the time being but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort trump isn reaching out it is strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign where instead of following the model of successful politicians like george bush and president obama by holding campaign rallies in swing districts hoping to persuade voters trump has rallies with the converted on election day in fox news viewers were shocked to find the romney landslide the network had kept promoting was harsh reality they may be setting themselves up for major failure featured image via flickr

liberals in the media and the political arena thought that hillary clinton victory was in the bag the rest of the campaign was mere formality in order for her to make the white house her residence once again her campaign plan was to lay low out of the spotlight make little to no contact with the press and just let donald trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention but now that the post dnc honeymoon is over they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn over and that they had grossly underestimated donald trump and his campaign add to that hillary frequent inconvenient health episodes and now even some democrats are talking about plan for the past few weeks the poll numbers have closed in with donald trump taking the lead in several key battleground states now even hillary is asking why she isn points ahead of trump at campaign event in las vegas hillary video conferenced in to address the labor international union of north america while she was talking about investing in infrastructure raising the minimum wage and collective bargaining she raised the question having said all this why aren points ahead you might ask well the choice for working families has never been clearer need your help to get donald trump record out to everybody nobody should be fooled at another point in her speech she encouraged her supporters to stage an intervention if they know anyone who supports trump if you do know somebody who might be voting for trump stage an intervention she said try to talk some sense into them lay out the facts the facts are on our side about what ve done versus what he done remember friends don let friends vote for trump the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

the recent connected bombings in new york and new jersey and the stabbing attack at mall in minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security hillary clinton and donald trump have spoken out since the attacks which left dozens of people injured john cohen former coordinator for the department of homeland security said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign have significant impact on voters when events occur like this you tend to have people become more fearful and when people are more fearful they tend to gravitate towards candidate who appears to be more strong said cohen who currently works as an abc news consultant three of the latest national polls all conducted before the attacks this weekend had clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism in an abc news washington post poll released sept clinton led percent to trump percent among all adults and percent to trump percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism cbs new york times poll released sept had clinton doing better job handling terrorism and national security according to percent of respondents compared with trump percent the split was closest in quinnipiac poll released sept in which respondents were asked who they thought would do better job keeping the country safe from terrorism regardless of how you intend to vote in that poll clinton got percent to trump percent traditionally it been the republican party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security but today that kind of flipped because despite his rhetoric there are number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that donald trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats cohen said andres kudacki ap photo current events are factoring into the political campaigns with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks but cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves he said trump rhetoric and calls to bar foreign muslims from entering the united states may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on isis behalf james campbell professor of political science at the university at buffalo in new york who has written book about political polarization told abc news that he believes the attacks translate to potential advantage for trump have to think that terrorist events in this country help trump and hurt clinton for these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem he said it may also suggest that we need tougher approach to dealing with terrorism an approach associated with trump when suspects are identified who have muslim sounding names then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny campbell added

according to testimony heard in federal court monday david wildstein former port authority director of interstate capital projects testified that in june bridget kelly christie former deputy chief of staff was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the democratic mayor of fort lee new jersey mark sokolich for christie reelection campaign wildstein who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation told kelly that shutting down access lanes to the george washington bridge to put some political pressure on sokolich was an option according to his testimony wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal sokolich testified last week that being democrat in democratic town put him in an uncomfortable position vis vis christie endorsement and he eventually declined because he did not want to alienate anyone on august and as cnn has previously reported wildstein received an email from kelly saying time for some traffic problems in fort lee got it wildstein responded phone call with kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward it was revealed in testimony monday did not question senior officials in the office of the governor wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures and communicated every step of the way with kelly and his then boss former port authority deputy executive director bill baroni according to his testimony wildstein and kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to fort lee officials or the public they discussed how the port authority would respond to any inquiries and agreed that all calls would be directed to baroni office and baroni would not return the calls testimony revealed this radio silence policy was discussed with and approved by baroni wildstein said wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to maximize the impact on fort lee wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with baroni and kelly baroni asked when the first day of school in fort lee was and when wildstein told baroni it was september baroni smiled and said fantastic according to wildstein testimony kelly agreed on the september date wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three fort lee access lanes but after discussing the matter with port authority engineers who feared this could cause sideswipe crashes wildstein recommended to baroni and kelly that they shut down two lanes on friday september wildstein informed several port authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on monday september bob durando port authority general manager of the george washington bridge expressed concern telling wildstein that the closures would cause mess wildstein told durando the closures would be going forward and to prepare accordingly told him not to say anything to anybody wildstein testified wildstein told durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to baroni office wildstein then informed former port authority chief engineer peter zipf of the closures and asked zipf to organize way to get some numbers on the traffic patterns wildstein also informed cedrick fulton port authority director of tunnels bridges and terminals fulton asked if port authority executive director patrick foye was aware wildstein testified that he told fulton yes but that this was lie all of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of traffic study on the day the closures began wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside port authority administration building on the fort lee side of the george washington bridge knew the plan that had set into motion was working wildstein testified port authority lieutenant also drove wildstein around fort lee so wildstein could see the traffic on the ground wildstein testified that he called kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up and she was pleased several calls and emails began coming in to baroni and wildstein from fort lee officials including the mayor sokolich but their plan of radio silence was put into effect and no messages were returned last week wildstein testified that baroni role at the bi state agency was essentially to be representative of christie administration and that their top priority was to represent christie office interests wildstein said he created phrase that he and baroni often used the one constituent rule this referred to the fact that governor christie opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to port authority affairs wildstein and baroni used the one constituent rule as barometer by which decisions would be made kelly and baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with bridgegate their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses

the department of homeland security inspector general said that people who were ordered to be deported or removed instead eventually received citizenship ap photo mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants at least people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the were instead granted citizenship the department of homeland security inspector general announced monday the mistaken citizenships were granted the department of homeland security explained in press release because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the fbi fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported story continued below the discovery was made by the department of homeland security office of inspector general which released report monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships the department of homeland security records are incomplete the release said because paper fingerprint cards used before were not consistently digitized the fbi records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau the inspector general report specified that those granted citizenship were only potentially ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly statement from the department of homeland security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship it is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently preliminary results from the file reviews show that in significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that in some naturalization was not improperly granted department spokesman neema hakim said in the statement other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to proceedings that are pending or completed in at least three cases the inspector general office discovered previously deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for security sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels the release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked this situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of citizenship through fraud inspector general john roth said to prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications citizenship and immigration services needs access to these fingerprint records republican presidential candidate donald trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the major part of his presidential platform suggesting during the gop primary that america temporarily ban all muslims from entering the until more stringent vetting process could be put in place he has since backed away from that proposal which drew widespread criticism from both parties in favor of ban on immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism authors

the pressure is on hillary clinton insiders in both parties agree clinton having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage faces higher expectations than donald trump when the two square off for the first debate on long island story continued below that according to the politico caucus panel of activists strategists and operatives in key battleground states roughly equal percentages of democrats percent and republicans percent said clinton is under more pressure to perform than trump but democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for trump relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues she shouldn be under more pressure but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself the press will give trump glowing review said nevada democrat who like all respondents completed the survey anonymously hillary will need strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and trump fails the commander in chief test the media and trump himself have set the bar too low for trump new hampshire democrat added presidents don get graded on curve and candidates in debates shouldn be either one ohio democrat detected double standard for the first female major party nominee hillary clinton has spent public lifetime of being held to strikingly different standard and this debate will be no exception said the ohio democrat she will have to answer every single question flawlessly exude gravitas look presidential channel bill and barack oratorical mastery not raise her voice not cough wear an acceptable pantsuit smile enough be likable not laugh and have good hair day donald trump will just have to show up republicans also said clinton was under greater scrutiny on monday night but for different reasons tightening polls that show trump eclipsing clinton in some battleground states somehow she needs to reverse the trend said an ohio republican never seen anyone do it before this will be her chance and maybe her last chance she has to stop trump momentum with strong debate performance and she has to be able to stand on the stage for minutes and look healthy for minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with vengeance added virginia republican all trump has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president among those insiders who said trump was under more pressure percent of democrats and percent of republicans most pointed to the gop nominee volatile personality hillary clinton is expected to do well she is policy wonk said michigan republican the pressure is on donald trump not to lose his cool he has been doing very well in his public appearances but that is with the assistance of teleprompter he will have no such help at the debate and if were coaching hillary clinton would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible to win the debate all trump really needs to do is meet expectations keep his cool and look presidential the question we are all waiting to have answered is can he be serious added michigan democrat can he answer questions directly how will he react or overreact when he is directly challenged can he control his temper two other takeaways from the pre debate survey most insiders expect clinton to win the debate majorities in both parties peg clinton as most likely to be the victor on monday night percent of democrats and percent of republicans media look at who best answered questions and that will likely be hillary said an iowa republican clinton mastery of issues and policies and no nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster name calling and promises that can never be kept added new hampshire democrat but not all democrats were so optimistic about clinton or the media through which voters will interpret the debate the press wants trump to win said florida democrat their disdain for her plus desire to keep the race alive means unless he really screws up they ll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever some republicans also claimed media bias in the other direction the media has never been more in the tank for candidate in modern history cnn nbc abc and politico will all say she won virginia republican said but then again everyone also knew that carter beat reagan in their debate as well insiders think the debate will matter asked whether they expect the debate to have significant impact on the race most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates among democratic insiders percent believe clinton will benefit from the debate percent think trump will get bounce and percent don expect the debate to move the needle trump will flounder ramble and lie because he always does michigan democrat predicted the moderators will challenge him and he ll get mad he ll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored hillary first impressions are hard to shake off and this won go well for him the numbers were flipped for republicans with slightly less enthusiasm for the gop standard bearer percent think the debate will help trump percent think it will help clinton and percent said it wouldn have significant impact trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even tempered said new hampshire republican he does that successfully and he cuts into hillary greatest strength but some republicans said clinton could stunt trump momentum with strong performance monday night if she pins his ears back it helps her said an iowa republican if it draw it net negative for her she has to have something to stop his momentum she got to hit him with brick other insiders however doubted whether the debate would have significant permanent effect on the race we re past the era of the big debate swings the bloodless dukakis death penalty answer the reagan age quip the bentsen you re no john kennedy moments an iowa republican said swing voters are like the california condor critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate opinion media partisan polarization and two highly unpopular candidates make this battle over very small group of voters in about dozen states and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears added florida democrat does damn thing matter this year think not these are the members of the politico

posted by frank wilkenmeyer on sep donald trump jr is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media in the very least it tossup between him and little brother eric who just yesterday made fool of himself with his childish self admiration for being the answer to crossword puzzle question along with free wifi pushup bras and bozo the clown together the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare when this election is finally over it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion maybe we ll keep track of their twitter accounts just for giggle every now and then today silliness begins with oompa loompa jr pinning tweet that is certainly relevant to particularly volatile national discussion happening right now colin kaepernick and the national anthem as more and more athletes decide to take knee in protest to support black lives matter more and more conservatives trash them for it calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage lord cheeto ii has been one of the most vocal accusing kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom for the left it simple matter of the st amendment regardless of how you feel about the issue these athletes have the right to express themselves yes that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism but let not forget that it people like little comb over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason for years we ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second so when this tweet appeared pinned to mini douche twitter account this morning couldn help but bust out in hysterical laughter clearly when you re the son of pure evil you have hard time understanding the words you use when liberals otherwise known as sane people try to explain why people like kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right we re attacked in frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing song is mandatory patriotism it not the first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of growing nation in the right to be you the supreme court has sided with those liberals every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and ll say it again the nd amendment is the only one they see as absolute all others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like donald trump jr featured image by gage skidmore
donald trump jr just pinned tweet so stupid it will make your eyes bleed opposition report
last week wrote an article titled donald trump amazing week which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and never trumpers everywhere guess what this past week has been even better for the republican nominee for president the man whose candidacy was considered vanity exercise year and half ago well no one is laughing anymore the latest round of polls shows that the support for the trump presidency is growing rapidly the latest fox news poll which was taken from september shows donald trump polling at one point lead over democratic nominee hillary clinton at the la times usc poll taken from september shows trump at with six point lead over clinton at the gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states the suffolk university poll which was taken from september shows trump at leading by points with clinton at the cnn orc poll which was taken september shows trump with point lead over clinton in florida clinton still has about point lead over trump in other key battleground states including pennsylvania and michigan but those gaps are getting narrower every day other states such as nevada and new hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for clinton have moved to the toss up state category donald trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform his childcare plan at speech in aston pa just outside of philadelphia spearheaded by his daughter ivanka trump trump childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum the plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers this benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program lower income families will also benefit from the plan offering of childcare rebates through the earned income tax credit eitc program up to per year middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns families will also have the ability to establish dependent care savings accounts dcsas to put money aside tax free for childcare low income families will receive match of the first deposited per year generating up to an additional per eligible family per year dcsas can be applied to pay for childcare after school enrichment programs and school choice families can also use the funds in dcsa to care for an elderly parent expenses including in home nursing and long term care finally trump childcare plan provides tax deduction for stay at home parents effectively eliminating the tax punishment for parent decision to leave the workforce to be full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent donald trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the economic club of new york which includes some of new york most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance trump excellent week continued with his visit to the dr oz show where he released letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history other than carrying an extra pounds trump appears to be in excellent health of course trump unveiling his medical records on television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about hillary clinton health following her fainting at last week september memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia again only donald trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event well it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on the dr oz show program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with large percentage of female viewers during the one hour program the discussion of trump health was followed by the appearance of ivanka trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women so yes somehow all this concern about hillary clinton health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for donald trump trump followed up the dr oz interview with visit to the tonight show with jimmy fallon during the visit trump permitted the late night comedian to do something unpresidential that is to say he told fallon that he could mess up his hair while most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre planned the fact that trump said yes to the display speaks volumes he demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have bad picture taken furthermore the tonight show is popular with democrats and millennials of all political persuasions once again trump had an opportunity to make connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the trump train oh and one more thing by letting jimmy fallon touch his hair on national television trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his however small it another check mark in the honesty and transparency box now if all of this was not enough donald trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in washington dc where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen medal of honor recipients trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed two years early and under budget metaphor for how he would manage the us economy he also seized the moment to put an end to the birther issue trump took the microphone and said not to mention her in the same breath as the medal of honor recipients who had just endorsed him hillary clinton and her campaign of started the birther controversy finished it finished it he said president barack obama was born in the united states period now we all want to get back to making america strong and great again trump said once again political correctness be damned donald trump has had another amazing week the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

trump was proposing vast expansion of stop and frisk policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling it was just another day in trump up and down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by hillary clinton and the democrats story continued below the effort has taken trump from black church in inner city detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural north carolina where on tuesday evening he proclaimed in small town named after slaveholder that black communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they ve ever been in before ever ever ever on wednesday trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter don king who dropped the word before group of pastors at cleveland church while extolling trump as gladiator king hailed trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered the system is the problem and he the only gladiator that will take on the system king said after the church event trump sat for town hall with fox news host and unabashed supporter sean hannity asked by an audience member what he would do to address violence in the black community trump embraced stop and frisk we did it in new york it worked incredibly well trump said fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that bill de blasio rode to prominence and ultimately the mayor office but even before trump stop and frisk comments he was taking heat for his ever ever ever remark tuesday night don know what mr trump is talking about to say that the situation for african americans is worse than it ever been rep john lewis the democratic civil rights icon said wednesday on msnbc is he talking about worse than slavery worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination when we couldn take seat at the lunch counter and be served worse than being denied the right to register to vote to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities trump polling numbers among african american voters have been dismal in the low single digits and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters particularly women and those in the suburbs that he is not racist trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks what do you have to lose he says to largely white audiences at the new spirit revival center in cleveland trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before diverse crowd seated to trump right was mike pence his soft spoken running mate to his left outspoken longtime attorney michael cohen behind him king

in oklahoma last week trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been choking in the fatal shooting trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents now did she get scared was she choking what happened but maybe people like that people that choke people that do that maybe they can be doing what they re doing ok king whom top gop officials had pushed not to speak at the republican national convention due to past manslaughter conviction was given the prime slot of introducing trump at forum billed as pastors leadership conference king clothed in sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of israel and the united states argued repeatedly that the system had oppressed minorities and women and only trump can upend it entirely every white woman should cast vote for donald trump said king who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of african americans told michael jackson said if you re poor you re poor negro would use the word but if you rich you are rich negro if you are intelligent intellectual you re an intellectual negro if you re dancing and sliding and gliding mean negro king said when trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later he grinned ah there only one don king before king cohen trump attorney used his time at the church to slash at the disgusting liberal mainstream media and its casting of trump as racist the word of the election has somehow become racist cohen complained ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting liberal mainstream media have attempted to label mr donald trump as racist xenophobe and bigot and let not forget sexist misogynist narcissist islamophobe anti hispanic anti semite demagogue and countless others it disgraceful cohen said not only is donald trump not racist he believes that all

in march in bold oh yeah moment during an interview with the washington post editorial board donald trump took the paper dare and revealed then and there his very short list of foreign policy advisers there were just five though he said have quite few more the list was head scratcher random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits one of the names offered without elaboration was carter page phd who story continued below reporters quickly googling found that page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called global energy capital and that he claims to have years of experience investing in russia and the energy sector as for his connection to trump when page was reached for comment by the new york times the day after trump big reveal he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he will be advising mr trump on energy policy and russia this piqued my interest have been russia wonk for most of my adult life spent years living and reporting from moscow still go there regularly for reporting trips and am in touch with lots of friends there and yet despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in russia no one spoke to had ever heard of carter page what this guy name says one former western energy ceo who spent years in russia and would have overlapped there with page had not heard of carter page before it came out in the media says another prominent western businessman who has worked in the former soviet union for over two decades but am getting lot of emails from friends asking have you heard of this guy strangely ve never heard of carter page until this trump connection bill browder responded to me in an email he was one of the biggest western players in the russian market until president vladimir putin turned on him and browder became his fierce critic it odd because ve heard of every other financier who was player on moscow at the time someone apparently has heard of him on friday yahoo news reported that page was being probed by intelligence for purported back channel ties to russian leaders the story resurfaced the name of character who all but vanished from the campaign and reawakened questions about who exactly trump was surrounding himself with this has been concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began real estate developer with almost no serious washington connections to tap for advice going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people trump famously told post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign we want top of the line professionals as the primaries unfolded it became increasingly obvious that trump would need all the top of the line help he could get when it came to foreign policy in an interview with conservative radio host hugh hewitt trump confused the kurds with the iranian al quds force couldn tell the difference between hezbollah and hamas and couldn recognize the name of the leader of isis in his defense trump said that hugh was giving me name after name arab name arab name and there are few people anywhere anywhere that would have known those names the republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti trump manifestos and since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate who were the people who would line up to advise him instead what would they be like enter carter page year old ph and business school graduate who claims an expertise in russia and energy yet who quickly discovered was known by neither russia experts nor energy experts nor russian energy experts can poll any number of people involved in energy in russia about carter page and they ll say carter who you mean jimmy carter says one veteran western investor in russian energy page also as would be surprised to discover appears largely unknown to trump own campaign what did find however is that while page might not be helping trump trump has been significant help to page since being named by trump as an adviser page who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in russia and the former soviet union has finally begun to be noticed in the region he is being treated in russia as person with potentially important ties in america he an extremely well informed authoritative expert on russia says mikhail leontiev pro kremlin talking head and spokesman for rosneft russia state oil giant people really respect him in this industry he very serious guy and he has good reputation according to the yahoo report intelligence believes page had an audience with top russian officials including rosneft head igor sechin during summer trip to moscow from what could find about him it hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by trump page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the american press march bloomberg profile touted his deep ties with executives at gazprom the state owned russian gas giant whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade last month the post ran piece that was breathless in different way casting him as shadowy broker with potentially important ties in russia some of them unsavory the yahoo story also portrays page as well connected high rolling businessman with extensive business interests in russia and an office around the corner from trump tower page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements including saying putin is better leader than president barack obama to june closed door meeting of foreign policy brahmins in washington in july in moscow he spoke at the new economic school commencement ceremony university that had hosted obama just seven years ago page used the speech to slam the hypocrisy of american foreign policy in front of russian audience saying washington and other western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization inequality corruption and regime change he is now frequently quoted on russian television which hails him as famous american economist and adviser to donald trump on questions of foreign policy all of which reveals something deeply strange about trump when he shoots from the hip his remarks do more than just whip up twitter controversies they also occasionally and unintentionally mint new species of insiders people who seem to be in trump orbit but who may not have and may never have had any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all but someone is paying attention as started looking into page began getting calls from two separate corporate investigators digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections page has to all kinds of shady russians one is working on behalf of various unnamed democratic donors the other won say who turned him on to page scent both claimed to me that the fbi was investigating page for allegedly meeting with igor sechin and sergei ivanov who was until recently putin chief of staff both of whom are on the sanctions list when page was in moscow in july for that speech so the question continued to linger who is carter page should tell you before we get any further that page wouldn talk to me for this story called his fund and left messages both on the general line and his personal voice mail emailed him repeatedly asked the trump campaign to put me in touch emailed the bloomberg journalist who interviewed him who passed the request on even called carter page father in poughkeepsie new york who told me he would ask his son to talk to me but alas no dice this was disappointing no one who worked in moscow when page was there seemed to know who he was and just wanted to talk to someone who did at certain point just needed confirmation that he even existed ok thought try different route maybe all these prominent western businessmen who worked in russia for decades didn know page but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the russian economy he did after all have such an impressive sum page biography on the website of his energy fund global energy capital hits all the right notes it was at first glance the sum of an up and coming player in the opaque but lucrative russian energy market he spent years as an investment banker at merrill lynch in london moscow and new york where he most recently served as chief operating officer of the energy and power group his bio reads he was involved in over billion of transactions in the energy and power sector he spent years in moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for gazprom rao ues and others those were some of the biggest energy deals of the and page tenure in merrill lynch moscow office from to would have put him in the right place at the right time he says he was part of the carving up of rao ues massive russian electric power holding company he told bloomberg that he advised gazprom when it bought stake in the sakhalin ii oil and gas project those were huge huge things if he were deeply involved he would definitely count as player and surely he left at least trace in the records of those deals so called ian craig the ceo of sakhalin energy from to who was doing the negotiations with gazprom and stayed on as ceo after the deal went through it wasn really deal to be clear sakhalin ii was large project in the far east and gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant controlling stake but craig said he didn know anyone named carter page he was also surprised to hear about merrill lynch purported involvement in the deal don think merrill lynch or anyone else was front lining the negotiations because it was all done at the highest level because it was very political says craig it closed at ceo level and eventually putin himself signed off on it when asked prominent western businessman who has worked in the former soviet union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with sechin and other members of the russian elite about page claim to bloomberg that he advised gazprom on sakhalin ii he said rolled my eyes at that one he too said he hadn heard of page until trump announcement fine ok maybe page exaggerated bit on that one but what about the reorganization and privatization of rao ues the russian electricity giant maybe some of the russians he worked with remembered carter page turns out they did his nickname was stranichkin from the russian word stranichka or little page says artem torchinsky who met page during the breakup of rao ues torchinsky who was part of the company financial department worked alongside page who at the time worked in merrill lynch moscow office it was and merrill lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of rao ues and torchinsky was resentful of page and the other merrill lynchers torchinsky and the in house team did all the work and page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation they were the fancy western window dressing it really irritated our team torchinsky told me over skype we worked around the clock and then they would come in and say something and we have to correct them these guys didn know what they were talking about as for page he made no impression whatsoever whether he was there or not it made no difference torchinsky says when you re dealing with pro you see it page unfortunately did not leave that impression ok harsh but then talked to page former boss former russian central bank chairman sergei aleksashenko who ran the moscow office of merrill lynch for part of the time page worked there he wasn great and he wasn terrible aleksashenko says exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone without any special talents or accomplishments someone who was gray spot what can you say about person who in no way is exceptional he asked me page was vice president at merrill lynch in moscow which sounds senior but is common title in the finance world big firm like merrill lynch might have thousands of vps in the moscow office there were five ranks and vp was right in the middle in effect it was just the oldest of the youngest three from the bottom says aleksashenko when it came to finance aleksashenko says page was not specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments when it came to energy page and his team were according to torchinsky mildly speaking not competent in the field of energy and says aleksashenko judging by the drivel he spews on russia you can tell he doesn really understand the topic trump putative adviser on russia and energy and foreign policy in other words did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well educated or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy says aleksashenko for the past few years page has styled himself foreign policy expert he has written columns in global policy journal new peer reviewed journal run out of durham university they are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps in recent months renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the united states after the killing of michael brown and eric garner by police officers in missouri and new york respectively he wrote although commonly overlooked the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions he is the kind of thinker who writes that kanye west new slaves and the artist creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of foreign policy and world affairs but does it by opening with citation from the oxford english dictionary slave pronunciation sl roping in adam sandler william buckley and dick cheney his speech in moscow new economic school was similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition tautologies and abuses of the word ironically for the last years ve been researching teaching and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it he began the video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and lifetime studying the place he couldn really speak russian he had to have his questions translated for him into english except to quote haltingly brokenly vladimir putin we never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries unlike the usa which is troubling for two reasons that the adviser of presidential candidate of major party is criticizing america abroad by citing putin and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in say syria or ukraine page also managed to find his way into fellowship at the council on foreign relations where he cut strange figure like other westerners doing business in russia page took the view that putin was not the blood stained and corrupt tyrant some in the west imagine him to be defending him as strong leader who brought order and prosperity to russia but unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of putin people at the council recall that page was not particularly good at it he had guilty seeming style in making these arguments making it seem like he didn really want to engage one person from the council says his columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows that blog post about the slaves that just strange says the council member he nice guy but of the people that know that have russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts he wouldn be in the last decile but he be in the second to last decile says one american executive with experience in russia and its energy sector you have to dip really far and wide to find guy like carter page mean wow should ve just dropped the carter page story but in the months since trump named him an adviser the campaign russia connections have become bigger and bigger issue fancy bear who was probably russian hacker broke into the democratic national committee emails seemingly handed them over to julian assange who continues to leak the information in way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other trump second campaign manager paul manafort flamed out in august because of his shady business dealings with the pro kremlin side of ukraine and trump himself continues to say absurd things about russia and putin like publicly inviting the russian government to continue hacking american servers washington was in full hunt for red october mode and it was all could do to stay on page trail which began to look more and more like an infinity sign was not the only one seemingly everyone talked to had also talked to the washington post and then there were these corporate investigators who drew dark and complex web of page connections then there was page praising putin found myself juggling two mutually contradictory page narratives was page like manafort followed by long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the west this was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear was page man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with china and turkmenistan who was vehicle for the kremlin to influence the american election was he man who during three day trip to moscow met with two of russia most powerful men and was now being investigated for it but it was hard to see that man when actually talked to people who knew him page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade securing spot at merrill lynch london and moscow offices today he claims he was cozy with gazprom executives his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion no one let him into gazprom aleksashenko says he didn go shake gazprom chief alexey miller hand he made sure there were cars hotels and meetings for investors in london another of page colleagues from merrill lynch confirmed that page role was simply arranging meetings between gazprom and western investors something normally done by analysts the lowest rank on the totem pole people organize meetings with gazprom all the time the former colleague said he hosted these guys in new york city but they would have done this times year used to do this it doesn require all that much skill you just send out an email to people saying gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at do you want to come the main thing is just getting those two gazprom guys to agree but because they agreed doesn mean they re close to him but the meetings did provide him with something else gazprom didn need money at the time says the former colleague they were the most profitable company at the time their net profit was something like billion year their problem was not getting investors but figuring out how to spend money in non efficient way if you read between the lines he was probably aware of that he would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is page became an investor in the company and has according to filings advised other companies he worked for to invest in them after merrill lynch page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it global energy capital but he tried to do this in and we know what happened to the markets in the fund is registered to his father address in poughkeepsie page listed himself as founder and managing partner even though the only other partner seemed to be sergei yatsenko who was once mid level executive at gazprom he also maintained website and handed out business cards that listed fancy madison avenue address that the one around the corner from trump tower which was actually the address of co working space that carter page says an american businessman who has spent nearly decade working in russia that what he been doing without any actual funding without any actual experience without any actual connections or core capabilities he been trying to throw together these deals he always been operating at level far beneath that at which business in russia is done admire that it takes lot of gumption in the interest of due diligence also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators that russia alfa bank paid for the trip as favor to the kremlin that page met with sechin and ivanov in moscow that he is now being investigated by the fbi for those meetings because sechin and ivanov were both sanctioned for russia invasion of ukraine don know this person said pyotr aven one of the two founders of alfa bank which is considered the western russian bank aven and his partner mikhail fridman have transferred much of their assets out of russia and have been quite critical of putin as for who paid for page trip aven was no less irritated by the question give them money don know how they spend it who they invite when they invite them have no idea he said of the new economic school which hosted page and of which aven is the main benefactor exasperated by my questions he snapped don bring these russian style conspiracy theories to me you are engaged in onanism said leontiev the spokesman for rosneft and sechin when asked him if page had met with sechin it bullshit just bullshit you need to understand who sechin is to even ask this question it hard to have meeting with him at all it absurd as for the fbi investigation well it unclear state department official who works on russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that for one thing there is no prohibition meeting with designated sanctioned individual moreover sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the fbi ofac runs them he added the story doesn add up what does seem to have happened is that various intelligence agencies were looking into page time in moscow then briefed senate minority leader democrat harry reid who wrote letter to fbi director james comey asking him to investigate among other things whether trump advisor who has been highly critical of and european economic sanctions on russia and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in russian energy conglomerate gazprom met with high ranking sanctioned individuals while in moscow in july of well after trump became the presumptive republican nominee got my next surprise when called stephen miller trump senior adviser caught him just as the trump plane was about to take off and asked him the tired old question who is carter page who says miller and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign he has no formal role in the campaign hope hicks texted responding to my question now my interest was piqued there were whispers all over washington that despite hicks denial page was not only still part of the trump campaign but its conduit for russian influence was he one way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with one source suggested to me that richard burt former ambassador to germany start treaty negotiator and longtime lobbyist for alfa bank was the nexus it was burt who helped draft trump foreign policy speech in april and had been advising the trump campaign via senator jeff sessions on foreign policy but when met burt at his office at the mclarty associates lobbying shop he looked at me and said he had never even met him the only person talked to about carter page is this guy at the washington post burt told me and told him never met the guy let me put it this way if have met him ve forgotten he the former merrill lynch guy right someone else told me that the page connection was rick dearborn sessions chief of staff who hired page because dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together foreign policy staff for trump alexandria virginia policy shop and he happened to know page but dearborn wouldn return my calls and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither dearborn nor burt but campaign co chair sam clovis who recruited page if he was part of that original group of people can say with percent confidence it was sam clovis this person told me not answering your questions clovis told me he refused to tell me if he was the one who found page but jason miller the campaign other spokesperson says carter page isn someone ve interacted with which confirmed what policy staffer on the trump campaign told me carter is red herring not rasputin he never met trump never briefed him he has zero influence none was page the shadowy messenger between the kremlin and trump tower or was he the nebbishy not very successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what trump said he my adviser and what his associates said who maybe wasn doing this right and maybe everyone was lying to me but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that regardless of whatever game the russians were running page was firmly in the latter camp don know about his russia fund other than it never really materialized says the prominent player in the energy space whom page has pitched on various energy projects every conversation ve had with carter has not been terribly serious they ve all been pie in the sky ideas there are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities he went on couldn name project that could connect carter name to any project that actually happened don know how he earned living off this the energy player says but think he been trying to be an intermediary if you hang around russia long enough it sort of like pinball machine something will hit you strangely it was not russian pinball that hit him it was trump according to the trump policy adviser this winter clovis began to draw up list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft at time when established republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from trump lot of people came to sam clovis in february march and said want to be part of the team says the trump adviser and that how it happened he just guy on list trump looked at the list and said he an adviser and now he milking it for all it worth now someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly very important person in washington or at least could plausibly market himself as one was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign and even after that had never heard of him one russia specialist in washington told me he saw page at washington roundtable in june for indian prime minister narendra modi and what he saw was strange kind of person one who was very differential to everyone there in way that someone who is junior would use it to network but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen and be impressed he was saying he was planning to go to moscow the russia specialist recalls he didn say what he was going to do there but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip according to congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on page trip to russia the meetings did happen and that been established as fact think the investigation is more what happened in them but it remained unclear the staffer told me unprompted what this even meant it not just did he met with them or not but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on said the staffer is he acting as conduit in ways that are against america national security interests wittingly or un should add it what hard to parse about this is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in john le carr novel or are they being played by much smarter people in the kremlin this seems to be vintage carter page man whose story never quite adds up as much as he tries to make the numbers work but he also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful more connected even more evil than he really is and to try to turn profit off of that if page using his status as trump advisor for personal gain that another matter time for page to join twitter michael mcfaul former ambassador to russia tweeted after news of the investigation broke the russians may be feeling out the trump campaign via page but page must be loving every minute of it after all meeting russia energy czar is an impossible dream for would be investor struggling to make it in the world of russian energy but the dream entered the realm of the possible when trump said three words in march carter page ph now carter page ph has found perfect candidate to latch on to like pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious trump shark for months now the american press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like page and manafort and through them to answer the questions of whether putin is trying to destroy america by their hands and is trump kremlin stooge or just useful idiot and is there even difference there doesn seem to be one in the world of trump which in some ways resembles putin the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive and that is all that matters is putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of western democracy in massive way or doing just enough to make us think he is and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of russia putin says of the rumors of russian meddling in the american election as we in the media continue to squeegee them around rarely really getting closer to the truth and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we ve finally grasped it julia ioffe is contributing writer at politico magazine
the mystery of trump man in moscow carter page
like much of the mainstream media the washington post is going out of its way to disparage donald trump but the post isn satisfied with the normal biased reporting they have gone above and beyond assigning reporters just to dig up dirt on the republican nominee that must have failed because now they are taking the lazy but disgusting way out with inappropriate hitler references twice in this month post columnists have compared donald trump to adolf hitler perhaps the editors have designated september as trump is hitler month at the washington post on monday they featured column by richard cohen which said in part while trump is neither an anti semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries he is hitlerian in his thinking he thinks the truth is what he says it is mr cohen didn mention what despot hillary lies reminded him of but then again the post would never have hillary is hitler month while hillary comparison would be just as wrong the fact that they are only creating trump month is incredibly sexist six day before mr cohen another columnist shalom auslander wrote don compare donald trump to adolf hitler it belittles the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

obama team isn laughing at trump anymore the president aides worry the republican represents more of america than fringe obamaworld laughed as it watched donald trump hostile takeover of the gop after eight years of republican opposition inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president president barack obama aides past and present thought republicans had gotten what they deserved and more all but forfeiting the race to the woman they defeated eight years ago they re not laughing anymore story continued below going into monday night debate obama team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top hillary clinton aides maybe the country isn what they thought maybe the resistance to obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they ve always dismissed maybe the president aides current and former now concede they re going to have to live with the fact that trump could end up in the oval office in part due to backlash against obama trying to think of series to compare it to which was series that started as comedy and became high stakes drama said ben labolt former white house aide and press secretary for obama reelection campaign feel like we re maybe in the fifth season of breaking bad here we re way beyond the laughs and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror there not lot of mirth in the circles run in about him said another former senior obama campaign staffer privately obama has expressed mixed feelings according to people close to the president he still nursing amusement at republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by trump but it mixed with frustration that there are so many americans he failed to reach people who ve spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in way that would make people who ve benefited from his policies like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of obamacare support democrats for obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into new buoyancy about the president climbing approval numbers trump growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on hope even if clinton wins the republican has shown not only that america is divided between red and blue but that there an america that obama never connected with at all and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as monopoly money we are still the country that elected barack obama in and we are capable of that and more said jim papa former special assistant for legislative affairs in the white house but we re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences trump already done things they never thought he could like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support and that was even before he riled up obama doubters again with his birther pirouette and the result trump doing better in the polls at this late stage than obama team imagined with days to go trump and clinton are essentially tied polls sitting within the margin of error even in battleground states though only few weeks ago current and former obama aides would joke about how the president great political legacy might be the republican party destroying itself in front of him now on the record they push back on the very suggestion that obama legacy should be viewed in any frame that trump also occupies don think he thinks it his legacy don think any of us think it his legacy said dan pfeiffer former senior adviser to the president trumpism is lot of things in this country president obama is the face of that for some republicans but the republican party got themselves into this mess but they worry about what even trump loss says about obama america think he will lose badly in this election but think the impact he had on our political process is incredibly damaging and will be lasting said tommy vietor former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at trump ended year ago he made us look stupid think he is stupid for any efforts obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable as the president likes to say trump has shattered that vietor said he has brought back brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can it doesn matter if it low blow it doesn matter if it not of substance that bad lesson for people to learn according to earnest obama is serious about wanting functional opposition and wishes that he had one to negotiate with on immigration reform trade infrastructure and other priorities the sense of lost opportunity eats at them as does the sense that it not going away despite their confidence in clinton chances not saying we all be playing acoustic guitar in circle on the national mall but am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts said white house press secretary josh earnest who been with the president since the first campaign not everyone inside obamaworld is down some schadenfreude remains he still exposed and ripped apart factions of the gop enhanced their brand as hostile to rising electorates and will leave them with no infrastructure said more upbeat former obama campaign spokesman hari sevugan and democrats sense of the vacuous gop that trump represents continues to resonate particularly as they see the republican nominee attack an economy that gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble the eight year legacy of the recovery from the great recession is clear evidence that the tea party movement said earnest is intellectually bankrupt or about something other than the economy but that doesn take care of their grief about the state of american politics rather live in world where the two parties really compete papa said than have political edge on the republican party but have to live in world where white supremacists have channel and are legitimized authors

off message is donald trump qualified to be president in the most pivotal moment of these are the questions he must answer mencken declared there was only one way to look at politician down likewise there really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on monday as the first serious job interview for potential president donald john trump an opaque candidate who has hidden behind steel curtain of one liners faux familiarity and universal celebrity story continued below yeah yeah yeah it big night for hillary clinton too she got lot to prove for real namely that she not the lying self dealing crook many americans think she is or at least convince the percent of voters who don like her that her virtues temperament and experience compensate for decades of assorted ick she needs to prove she can stand up to trump answer the usual email foundation questions convince whoever still sellable on the idea stop instagramming picture of your lunch millennials and listen up that she not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second john roberts drops the swearing in bible but the spotlight belongs on trump who is in need of rigorous job interview clinton deserves the same but she is already the single most scrutinized parsed vetted investigated attacked and plaudited non incumbent to ever seek the presidency she been around forever making enemies since the internet was dial up cell phones were the size of skateboards and trump was engaged to marla maples everyone makes the orange jokes but trump is something of black box running on few big and broad ideas curbing illegal immigration ditching bad trade deals restoring american prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness he bad with facts and the truth and perhaps worse takes perverse pride in being student who doesn read books has the sketchiest sense of history doesn read briefing materials and according to aides and ghostwriters can even sit still long enough to be given thorough verbal briefing these are not nasty biased liberal opinions they are facts based on reporting and trump own public performances here are five questions trump needs to address on monday but taken together they add up to one big one is donald trump qualified to be president of the united states does he actually know or care to know the basic information needed to competently run the country only one verdict of presidential fitness counts of course and that candidate capacity to get to electoral votes in recent days trump who swooned after clinton superb convention in philly has closed to within the margin of error in many though not all national polls and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like ohio and iowa since aug he still the most unpopular candidate in recent history although clinton is number two with bullet and seems to have ceiling of between and percent nationally but he can win fivethirtyeight com the arch aggregator gives trump nearly percent chance of prevailing his resurgence proves three political points two of them we knew the third is surprise to everyone except trump and his team the country especially the white working class parts is pissed clinton is perennially lousy candidate and lastly but not leastly trump has proven to be resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity developed late in the game to shift shape and shut up when he needs to the first debate should be pivot from politicking to president ing being cunning candidate isn remotely the same thing as being ready to rule and we should be moving to the doris kearns goodwin phase of the campaign where the top priority is fitness to govern in time of trial it probably won happen but boy can dream this is not to suggest that trump can do the job ronald reagan another entertainer who forayed into politics was mostly success but he been judged as performer up to this point and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs apparently he wasn aware russia had annexed crimea until george stephanopoulos informed him recently he obliterated jeb bush that humbled patsy of the gop establishment in the debates but bush if anyone had cared to listen punctured trump bully boy promise to impose tariffs on chinese products correctly pointing out that such move would certainly spark countermeasures by beijing that could lead to global depression trump wasn aware of that fact or just didn care the caring part is kind of important if history is any guide in april sat down with one of his longtime advisers roger stone who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self confidence and supreme impatience all you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not said stone who has known the gop nominee for decades when you write something for him keep it short and staccato he not going to read page white paper on the economy zero chance of that it just too boring don blame him don like it either so keep it simple and direct because that the way he communicates stone argued that trump isn an ignoramus just cut to the chase decision maker who is lightning quick study but george bush advisers speaking to biographer peter baker said that bush unwillingness to ask probing informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in iraq and during the nadir of the global economic meltdown president obama added daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis trump capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless but there not single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job many americans might not give damn that he knows what hud section program is and his failure to answer informational questions that clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw the media base but don people have the right to know what he actually knows trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns so why should moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of presidential candidate does trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of american constitutional government again this is not given hillary clinton despises the press and dodges them as if they were pack of feral rats but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts trump who banned news outlets including this one from his events for most of the campaign routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and in february went so far as to say we re going to open up those libel laws so when the new york times writes hit piece which is total disgrace we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they re totally protected that new one for presidential nominee as corey brettschneider wrote in politico magazine last month for more than years the supreme court has held that for public figure to prove libel against news outlet they must show that the outlet acted with actual malice that is with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not during private meeting with hill republicans earlier this year the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for article of the constitution the framers stopped at seven he was just listing out numbers said congressman blake farenthold texas trump backer at the time think he was confusing articles and amendments ok let write that one off as gotcha you can understand constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse but consider his reaction to the paris bombings last november when trump told fox news he thought the government should shutter some mosques where some bad things are happening the comment was decried by constitutional scholars of all stripes as radical measure that would violate the free exercise clause of the first amendment pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds why won trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts hillary clinton has appropriately has come under intense scrutiny for her six figure speeches to big wall street firms like goldman sachs and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats and serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the clinton foundation the state department and big money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism but the clintons have released all of their tax returns in part because for many years they were required to do so as government employees and trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over single one why does it matter because guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof in the same way that clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the white house senate and state department at issue is trump fundamental personal narrative and his claim that he very very rich he is but maybe not quite as much as he claims he says he good for billion forbes and other outlets say he worth less than half that much more serious is the issue of trump debts the clinton campaign citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in china and elsewhere has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords if that lie there an easy way to prove it by releasing the returns this isn liberal media witch hunt many republicans including supporters like house speaker paul ryan say he needs to cough them up and fast what the deal with his charitable foundation then there the matter of trump sloppily run and less than magnanimous foundation in expos after expos washington post reporter david fahrenthold has reported on pattern of over promising donations and the misuse of funds including quarter million payment to cover legal fees for trump businesses and sports memorabilia that trump himself has conceded might be illegal the problem yet again is that trump has refused to release comprehensive accounting of his giving and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity according to the reporting of fahrenthold and others why lie these days the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs if presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny the only person allowed on the debate stage at hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system but if trump is to be vetted for the presidency he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he made in the past but his pattern of lying stretching the truth and bungling facts hillary clinton crooked hillary in trump parlance it bears repeating is no saint far from it and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading bordering on the untruthful and flat out lies in the view of gop congressional investigators but it crowning irony of that the republican party whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness especially george bush claims about iraq would nominate the most brazenly truth challenged candidate in recent history recitation of trump whoppers would take up too much space read politico comprehensive donald trump week of exaggerations and half truths for taste in an attempt to defend trump buddy newt gingrich who lobbied to be trump running mate tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has trouble with all those pesky facts clinton the former speaker wrote is fox who knows many things you can fact check trump is hedgehog who knows one big thing but getting the facts right and telling the truth is big thing it the only way citizens will ever look up to and not down on their leaders authors

shares share this story republican attacks on transgendered americans and the religious fight to keep gender binary delineation took turn for the bizarre this week when virginia republican mark cole filed bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their anatomical sex local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom locker room or shower room that is designated for use by specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation such policies may also provide that student may upon request be granted access to the extent reasonable to single stall restroom or shower unisex bathroom or controlled individual use of restroom locker room or shower any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for civil penalty not to exceed civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the literary fund any law enforcement officer may issue summons regarding violation of this section he did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished but it hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom notably it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in single person bathroom which the department of justice ruled in june was violation of the student rights it is disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools the gop must accept that america is multi gendered multi ethnic nation and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that

breaking liberal rag huffington post is really running with this story from the washington post about the cia confirming russian interference in the presidential election they re saying if true the courts can put hillary in the white house scary from huffpo federal court ruling out of pennsylvania may offer some clues to clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent in light of late breaking reports friday evening that russians interfered with the presidential election to assist donald trump victory clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies at friday evening the washington post broke an explosive story alleging that russians had interfered with the presidential election in order to assist donald trump in victory over democratic candidate hillary clinton the story reveals that cia assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to president obama and top congressional leaders last week the development has clinton supporters and other concerned americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies no clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome article ii of the constitution vests congress with the power to determine the date by which the electoral college will cast their votes presently set for december in recent weeks massive online movement asking members of the electoral college to become faithless or conscientious electors and to vote for clinton instead of trump has garnered national attention the electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so say groups like hamilton electors which claims that the purpose of the electoral college is to prevent demagogues like mr trump from assuming the nation highest office petition urging the electoral college to make hillary clinton president has gained nearly million signatures proponents of this strategy are concerned with good reason about the likelihood it will succeed with donald trump having won electoral college votes republican electors would need to switch their votes to clinton tall order and in the event that no one candidate has electoral votes the decision would go to the republican controlled house of representatives

johnny depp made big mistake when he threatened to assassinate president trump his little stand up routine that wasn funny has now landed him in the back of black suv on the way to federal holding facility for questioning special agent bob argueta was barking orders at other people at the scene before we enticed him with jerky to give us statement skip tetheluda whose jerky has landed more than few exclusive interviews says argueta was told to take depp deep and dark into the night make sure they weren followed and bring him for advanced interrogation he responded to allegations that this takes joke by an actor way too far people just assume he was kidding what they don know is that depp actually had maps and timetables and plans to assassinate president trump if he ever visited concord new hampshire again which he certainly would during the general election season depp is dangerous criminal some of the content on his computer indicate he may have been radicalized while he was studying in muslim waters for his captain jack sparrow role there you have it if they found out depp was muslim convert with plans to kill the president he may never see the light of day again it difficult to think of our favorite actors as such horrible people sometimes but hollywood is just filled with tree hugging self righteous prius driving freaks comments comments

there is not day that goes by that we don hear about muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world but that hasn stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity those of us that criticize the so called religion of peace are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous muslims are in europe those that speak out against islam are being imprisoned for their belief courts are actually sentencing people for islam anti blasphemy laws while this may be par for the course in europe right now it is not the way we roll in america until now minnesota has just established similar law anti blasphemy laws are huge victory for muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards sharia law according to minneapolis local newspaper the star tribune the hotline was set up as way to target trump supporters who muslims believe are the group of people most likely to harass them the star tribune reported the city of minneapolis has set up hotline for residents to report hate crime incidents and other acts of intolerance the service operated through the city helpline is aimed to aid targets of any harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice according to city news release issued on monday the announcement comes amid signs of recent surge of such incidents affecting muslims and jews across the country many of which go unreported since the general election many of us have experienced witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of racism xenophobia sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the united states minneapolis department of civil rights director velma korbel wrote in statement posted on the city website in no uncertain terms hate motivated speech and actions have no place in minneapolis nor will they be tolerated the city department of civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government enforced fascism as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state this hotline flies right in the face of our united states constitution where it goes to the heart of denying american citizens their inalienable rights of the first amendment which governments can not do of course the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the constitution or the rights of americans as they are using their position to establish soft version of anti blasphemy laws in no uncertain terms hate motivated speech and actions have no place in minneapolis nor will they be tolerated minneapolis department of civil rights director velma korbel wrote in statement posted on the city website the department echoes the sentiments of minneapolis mayor betsy hodges who went on to blast president trump pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office she stated will not compromise the public safety of the people of minneapolis to satisfy trump desire to put politics before public safety minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and am grateful for their commitment to our city stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the president elect prepares to take office the idea of an anti blasphemy hotline in america is pretty absurd but right up liberal alley why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us don they want to protect their loved ones this is only the beginning of the democrats plans to take control of our country again but what they don realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to muslim demands this anti blasphemy hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it it is very similar to nazi germany approach in the when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as threat trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as major threat to our freedom what do you think share this with your friends and family freedom daily

house speaker paul ryan wi this week disputed reports that million people would lose insurance under the republican health care plan during an interview that aired on tuesday fox news host brian kilmeade asked ryan to respond to recent congressional budget office cbo report that said there would be million more people without health insurance by if the senate version of the health care bill is signed into law what they are basically saying at the congressional budget office if you re not going to force people to buy obamacare if you re not going to force people to buy something they don want then they won buy it the speaker opined so it not that people are getting pushed off plan it that people will choose not to buy something that they don like or want kilmeade then asked ryan to comment on the fact that the republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer americans ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is choice this is something we ve been over on more than once occasion ryan said know why you re asking me this you want me to feel guilty for depriving million people of health insurance right well sorry brian but it not working and the reason why it not working is you re using the wrong logic here you re using the wrong logic alongside millions of other americans because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing that not right why should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who don want to work hard and instead rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or in this case affordable health insurance ryan opined the answer is they shouldn this is land of opportunities but the thing is to be able to capitalize on those opportunities one has to be willing to work hard and that the only condition working hard if you work your butt off every single day you can afford whatever you want including the best health insurance possible now we arrive at my ultimate point if you choose to work hard if that choice you make every time you wake up in the morning then this is something that guarantees your success but if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you then you re doomed being rich or poor is matter of choice that all there is to it so let me ask you this brian if million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they re going to be healthy if they choose to be poor then it their own problem if they can afford to be healthy think of the message we be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people we be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing just come on over and become citizen the government will get you free food free shelter and free health insurance and you don even have to get job that preposterous anyone who thinks that good thing deserves to be poor he concluded

the biggest story this week was the arrest of pakistani muslim and longtime aide of debbie wasserman schultz imran awan earlier this year awan and his two other brothers were caught trying to leave the country with stolen laptops that contained top secret information from various congressmen shortly after the brothers were arrested criminal investigation commenced and imran realized that he was going to go to jail for very long time in his attempt to avoid facing justice awan tried to flee the country but was picked up by police at the dulles international airport this of course is scandalous to say the least and it was turned up another few notches after imran hired his lawyer the lawyer that was hired to defend imran was no other but close clinton family associate and lawyer chris gowen here is more from conservative review in gowen went to bat for hillary clinton aide huma abedin whose family is deeply connected to the muslim brotherhood after gop reps explored abedin nefarious ties gowen pledged to stand with huma along with his private practice the longtime clinton aide is also an adjunct professor at american university washington college of law where he teaches courses on legal ethics and law practice management gowen clinton connections are intriguing on another level given that awan employer in the house rep debbie wasserman schultz remains close clinton confidant the former democratic national committee chair resigned from her position after emails surfaced alleging she attempted to tip the scales of the democratic primary in clinton favor wasserman schultz was also the campaign co chair of hillary clinton first failed run for president reading this you would think that the mainstream media would be reporting this story non stop but that has not occurred at all in fact abc nbc and cbs have dedicated whopping seconds to this political scandal of course that seems ludicrous but it is obvious that the mainstream media does not want to get to the bottom of this at all however that has not stopped americans from pressing for more information and the heat is getting debbie wasserman schultz now they are reports that debbie is not fairing well and has been an absolute wreck since imran arrest also there are calls for debbie to testify before congress growing louder and it seems that she is about to cave here is more from conservative fighters debbie wasserman schultz employed pakistani it staffers and brothers who were paid over million dollars over the course of their employment even though they were accused of cyber security breach imran awan was arrested as he attempted to flee the after wiring approximately to pakistan fox news is the only cable network covering this huge scandal when imran awan was arrested he was carrying in cash on him his wife was carrying of cash when she fled the country too imran and his muslim brothers abid and jamal accessed unauthorized computers while acting as it specialists the three brothers were making and and one of the brothers has criminal background word has it that debbie wasserman schultz is an absolute wreck since imran awan was arrested calls for her to testify to congress are increasingly growing as well wasserman schultz knows she in hot water over this it scandal the gateway pundit previously reported the fbi seized smashed hard drives belonging to imran awan we also reported that debbie wasserman schultz threatened the chief of the capitol police with consequences for holding equipment that she says belonged to her in order to build criminal case against pakistani it staffer suspected of massive cyber security breaches it is rather clear in watching the video that debbie wasserman schultz has something to hide since why would she threaten the police if there was nothing in the equipment that could point back to her or the clinton john cardillo reports florida politicos who have known wasserman schultz for years are telling me she nervous wreck barely able to function since imran awan arrest fl politicos who have known dwstweets for years are telling me she nervous wreck barely able to function since imranawan arrest john cardillo

this story but will report the fake russian collusion story and president trump ban on transgenders in the military they will do anything they can to stop the real truth of what is happening in our government to be revealed debbie wasserman schultz holds the key to many answers that the american people deserve to know hopefully by keeping the pressure on wasserman schultz she will crack and we

it might be hard to believe after all many of us had used vick vaporub it seems like harmless ointment effective for fever nasal congestion and many other affections but this case will make people question its use especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she living the loss of her years old baby when she came back from work she came into her baby room when she got near to kiss him she felt he had fever she imagined it was just common cold and thought about home remedy to relieve him she rubbed vick vaporub on his chest back and under his nose to help him breathe she tucked him up and laid down next to him she was tired so she fell asleep next to her baby hours later when she woke up she noticed her son wasn breathing she carried him and took it to the hospital to save him but sadly everything was pointless the baby had been dead for hours the medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment she never imagined that home remedy would take his baby she only wanted to help him breathe and the ointment did exactly the opposite the thing is this remedy is effective for adults however for babies younger than two years old the ointment increases the mucus by the mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing the label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than years old sadly in the case of the mexican mother the warning went unnoticed using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world but we hope this story draw attention to this fact when children are concerned we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy we must not let simple mistake take our loved ones we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness

the republican war on women continues unabated the same week that conservatives argued in the supreme court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan indiana joined the ranks of states like texas and florida in passing draconian law that purports to protect women while in fact endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get and gov mike pence recently signed it the bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible and ideally something women can get legally at all asked to comment on his approval of piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms pence argued in an interview with the huffington post that abortion as such was mistake since the day it was first invented so let get that straight right away oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because believe that killing someone or something if you will that hasn developed consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime and if we re murderers of innocent beings who can defend themselves how are we to expect people with fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other the indiana governor said and as if that wasn enough pence continued we ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness and others just flat out prohibit it and that bad for number of reasons first and foremost we can have this kind of freedom of choice this is bad let be clear and that part of the reason why signed this bill because believe abortion or going to flat out call it murder this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state so indiana is just step in the right direction pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion first and foremost because this is such sensitive topic let me just say that sympathize with rape victims not just in america but around the world can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma he said however that does not justify murder not even that justifies murdering baby not in my book because what would happen we then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion and that has to be stopped at all cost donald trump new running mate also said basically if have said no on the bill that would be just like giving out get pregnant without fear cards because at the end of the day women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they do in the event of pregnancy and you know it not supposed to be like that that would be equal to me picking up butcher knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street that would be murder and not murderer and it gets worse when you get an abortion you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover and there are lot of crazy people out there what if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work mean indiana economy is struggling as it is and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state telling you made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run pence concluded
mike pence allowing rape victims to have abortions will lead to women trying to get raped

this is disaster in late december state senator doug ericksen proposed new law that would give authorities the ability to charge protesters with economic terrorism and slap them with serious felony charges that could lead to jail time just for making their voices heard the outrageous bill which has now had been formally introduced for consideration during the legislative session would make any form of protest that causes an economic disruption class felony punishable by up to years in prison it wouldn just apply to people who engage in illegal acts or vandalism it could be used to prosecute any person or group who organizes protest that authorities deem as disruptive broadly interpreted this law could apply to time honored traditions of nonviolent dissent like boycotts and civil disobedience we ve already hit our initial goal of signatures on the petition but now that the bill has been introduced we need to get even more people speaking out if everyone reading this shares the video we can easily get signatures before we deliver it to the washington state lawmakers charging protesters with terrorism clearly violates the first amendment and is an attempt to silence legitimate dissent please sign the petition telling lawmakers to reject this dangerous legislation here the text of the petition organizing and participating in protests is basic constitutional right guaranteed by the first amendment urge all lawmakers to reject any legislation that criminalizes protesters or labels protests as form of economic terrorism

cnbc reported that trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline trump early decision to approve the pipeline was conflict of interest and we must impeach him for it donald trump business investments spread throughout the world now we know that he has ties to the dakota access pipeline the one that crosses sacred indian land the construction of the pipeline raised the ire of native american sioux settlements in the area it will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply the pipeline is also threat to the missouri and mississippi rivers which provide drinking water for millions of people in addition the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country opposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests the protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them the opposition brought out many supporters too on november there was national day of action to protest the construction there were massive protests in cities as los angeles chicago denver and trump own manhattan in support of the sioux nation veterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs american heroes supporting native american heroes and now we learn that president trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines no wonder the orange fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president this should come as no surprise since trump financial ties are everywhere almost daily we hear of another financial conflict of interest involving the president this involvement is another example of trump failure to divest himself of his businesses interests the tenth amendment of the constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president and here it is another violation according to ethics experts trump decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate as with other presidents he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in blind trust the blind trust would prohibit trump from any involvement as he wants it his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly and he would surely lie about it the dakota pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by trump but perhaps the most controversial if only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of trump support of the cruel actions of the police we must insist that the media tell this story with its broadcast the public will see how trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment please share this story on facebook

one of the things that the bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the lord name in vain in fact one of the ten commandments in the old testament states you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain exodus the word vain means for no reason or useless thus god was instructing the israelites to avoid using his name in useless disrespectful way instead the israelites were supposed to revere the name of god and use it in serious considerate way many of the ancient israelites were so respectful of the name of god that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used because they thought that any quill that had written god name was holy and should not be used for regular words dr john hagee the founder and senior pastor of the cornerstone church in san antonio texas not only agrees with what the good book says but also takes the faith to level of fanaticism speaking exclusively with newslo hagee stated that in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should saying the lord name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now even in churches all across america hagee elaborated but that precisely the problem if the shepherds of faith start doing wrong what is the flock supposed to do follow in their footsteps don think so the flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself the pastor reprimanded but nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look including houses of god which are the holiest of places asked how the situation could be bettered hagee replied well we have to start with ourselves as with everything in life if you re asking about my personal opinion there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using god name than women who use it during sex that is one of the filthiest most derogatory and sinful uses of the lord name can think of if it were up to me would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail that would be fine example of god wrath aimed at what is in my opinion terrible misuse of our maker good name religionlo com comments comments

when donald trump proposed in that we place temporary ban on muslims entering the united states it was at time when europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism isis was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed whether it was jihadi running over people with truck the paris bombings or even the german priest that was beheaded for being christian they all were fueled by islam people need to understand that islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the united states georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional muslim veils state rep jason spencer filed legislation on wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver license photos while wearing veil the measure also adds burqas to law that makes it misdemeanor to wear face covering in public or while driving spencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about islamic terrorism spencer bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down public sidewalk this bill is simply response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of islamic terrorism and we in the state of georgia do not want our laws used against us spencer told wsb tv in atlanta many people will immediately read this and argue that the first amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms and that is true and correct argument our constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose here is the problem islam is not religion it is cancerous disease that calls for all christians women and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god allah vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of allah when was the last time we experienced terrorist attack from someone citing the bible quran will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them quran fight against those who believe not in allah nor in the last day nor forbid that which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth islam among the people of the scripture jews and christians until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued fight against those who believe not in allah nor in the last day nor forbid that which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth islam among the people of the scripture jews and christians until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued quran soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers for that they joined companions with allah for which he had sent no authority is that what we want to blossom in our country schools and communities just for starters liberals already banned school prayer because christian values may offend someone so how is this any different there is difference between hijab and burqa spencer is arguing that we should ban the full on cover that cloaks women from head to toe while liberals will decry this action they better accept it because it will have snowball effect in the united states outside of georgia several other states are starting to propose similar legislation the threat of islam and those that practice it are so severe that france and belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe local governments in italy spain and switzerland have also instituted bans

lifetime as an outcast in my family you see my father was pastor and my mother was physician came from very stable background and my parents were heavily into the church they controlled everything in my life they financed my education sent me money every month and paid virtually every bill that had they wanted to see me succeed in life and didn want to disappoint them when moved to atlanta met other gay men who were more comfortable with their sexual orientation pulled strength from these men and bonded with them immediately they taught me that it was ok to be gay and that life was too short to live my life for others over the next few months my circle started to consist of nothing but gay men felt comfortable felt that could express myself without judgement and for the first time ever felt accepted as time passed by started coming out of the closet little more each day at first would never attend gay club because of fear of being outed my friends eventually talked me into attending gay club for the first time was nervous you see had sister who attended spelman college and four other male cousins who attended clark the last thing needed was my family to find out my sexual orientation that would mean the possibility of my parents cutting me completely off and they were the ones paying for my tuition books and college expenses eventually put my fears aside after night of drinking with my friends we loaded up into my friends ford explorer and headed over to club called traxx apparently this was the gay club that everyone in atlanta attended on saturday remember walking into place that resembled poorly decorated high school gym it was huge there had to be over people in the place and they were dancing the night away because we were underage we couldn drink apparently everyone over received special wrist band to indicate their age and no one in my party had one after awhile of standing around we were starting to become over it clubs aren as fun when you are sober and the liquor we had drank earlier was starting to wear off while standing on the side noticed guy staring at me and smiling he was very attractive and every time would catch him looking in my direction would look the other way this entire gay lifestyle was still new to me so didn know what to take his stares for eventually he worked up the nerve to come over to me and strike up conversation he told me that looked familiar and asked me where was from told him that was from charlotte north carolina and couldn possibly look familiar had never been to gay club and every one of my gay friends were college freshmen from different cities around the country he asked me why wasn drinking and told him we couldn buy drinks because we were all under he offered to buy us round of drinks at his expense jumped at the offer because we wanted to enjoy ourselves that night after all no one comes to club to have bad time he returned minutes later with three drinks the drinks he ordered for us were long island iced teas remember taking sip and almost spitting the drink out it was very strong rather than be rude and waste his money drank it slowly stephawn then asked why was babysitting my drink asked what did he mean by that because had never heard the phrase used before he told me to hurry up and finish my drink he was going to order us another round by the time the second round came was feeling nice we continued to talk and he kept buying me drinks after the third round was borderline drunk and so were my friends every time he ordered me drink he also ordered my friends drink too after awhile my friends wanted to leave and told him that would catch up with him later he asked me to stay little longer and promised to take me home ditched my friends and for the rest of the night it was just me and him we ended up leaving the club an hour later while taking me home he told me that he wanted to stop by his house real quick to grab some gas money since his car was on we pulled into an apartment complex in the lindbergh area of buckhead he told me to come up with him so did as soon as the door to his apartment closed he started passionately kissing me we eventually ended up in his bedroom where we kissed for hours it seemed he started unbuckling my my pants and stopped him confessed that was virgin and didn have clue what was doing he told me to relax and that everything was cool he said everyone started off as virgin at some point in there life and that he could teach me how to have sex he made me turn over on my stomach and took my shoes off then he took my pants off was tense and nervous didn know what to expect but he was so attractive wanted every ounce of this man the first thing he did was start eating my ass and moaned passionately as he gently ate my ass for hours it seemed next he started sucking my from the back while was laying on my stomach it felt amazing wanted to please him too but he told me to chill and go with the flow then he started grinding on my ass and rubbing his on my ass crack he grabbed some lotion that was strategically placed on his nightstand he rubbed the lotion in my ass crack and then put some on his index finger he slowly put his finger inside of my ass moaned in extacy because he was stroking my while he was massaging my prostate with his finger after awhile of fingering me he tried to put his in my ass raw immediately stopped him asked if he had condom and he said yea why said because didn come to atlanta to catch anything and safe sex was mandatory with me he ran some line about being recently tested the week before and said that cool but we just met if we were going to have casual encounter it needed to be safe casual encounter he jumped up and grabbed magnum out of his dresser watched him put the condom on and then buried my face into the pillow it was painful at first didn understand how men could possibly enjoy what felt like having your insides ripped out had to stop him several times because could not take the pain after about minutes he was starting to get impatient couldn take the and he seemed to be over waiting for me to get used to the pain didn want to disappoint him and didn want my first sexual experience to be horrible with my partner not being satisfied decided to man up and squirted some more lube on my ass laid on my stomach and put my face back into the pillow he inserted his inside of my ass and this time it didn hurt as much he started to increase his stroke and had no problem taking it he was grabbing my waist and attempted to throw my ass back like had seen in the porno movies whatever was doing he was enjoing it because he was moaning in extacy after minutes of king me doggy style he screamed he was going to cum as he came felt warm liquid inside of my ass jumped up and looked back and saw his without condom on it screamed what happened to the condom he grabbed around the bed and showed me the condom there was no cum in it and it was by the foot of the bed ran to the bathroom because it felt like had to when used the bathroom his cum rushed out of my ass it was allot kept thinking to myself that this motherf ker took the condom off while king me that was the only explanation for cum being in my ass because watched him put the condom on came out of the bathroom with an angry look on my face said nigga just used the bathroom and your cum came out of my ass asked him if he took the king condom off he said no he said that it must have broke wasn buying it and searched around for the condom found the used condom on the bed and started examining it the condom wasn broke at all rolled it out and there was nothing wrong with it screamed what the did you do because this condom isn broken he told me that was tripping and ran to the bathroom with the condom and put it up to the faucet filled the condom with water and it didn leak at all when did that he told me to get the out of his house felt betrayed was scared for my life and was hurt had heard about atlanta being one of the cities with the highest aids rates in the country and was determined not to be statistic got my things and got out of his house this asshole didn even take me home and it was am in the morning as waited outside of his apartments in the cold called cab service they arrived about minutes later and took me home the entire time he was texting my phone and calling me non stop didn answer his calls because didn want to talk to him was convinced that he had purposely took the condom off while king me there was no other explanation for his cum being inside of me know some guys get off by that but was disgusted by it the thought of his cum inside me made my stomach turn as the liquor wore off went into deep depression when got to my dorm popped two tylenol pm and fell alseep didn tell anyone about my experience how could explain that had sex and my partner purposely took the condom off and came inside my ass unprotected had just met this man didn even know his real name when my friends asked me what happened said nothing and gave them look that said don ask me anymore questions they didn ask and didn tell that experience frightened me so bad that decided to put my sexual desires on hold and focused on my education that meant pulling back from my gay friends too because was starting to get little too reckless and free with my sexuality started hanging more with my straight friends after all had to keep my charade up had family that attended my school so couldn be seen with bunch of gay men months later while home for christmas break had to see my doctor for my yearly checkup this was something my mother made me do ever year since can remember my doctor asked me was sexually active and said no told him that had sex once but that was it wasn sexually active because wasn actively having sex he told me that he was going to include an hiv test in my regular blood work anyway few days later received call from his office it wasn the doctor it was one of the office workers she was obviously new because didn recognize her voice she told me that needed to come in because there was something that the doctor needed to discuss with me was confused asked her what something was and she said that she couldn release this information over the phone and that should come in today this was very unusual because had never had this happen before and had been getting yearly checkup from the same doctor for over years at first thought it could be high blood pressure because that ran in my family there was also chance of cancer because the women in my family had breast cancer and my grandfather passed away from prostate cancer borrowed my mothers car and headed over to the doctor office didn want to scare her so didn mention what was borrowing the car for will never forget what happened next as arrived to my doctor office was told to have seat in the waiting room there was soft music playing that turned out to be barry manilow daybreak and it made my stomach turn hated that king song was in no mood to hear happy go lucky song when was being called into my doctor office to discuss my lab results before the song could end the doctor opened the door and escorted me to an exam room it was cold there was no window and the light was very bright brighter than usual he began to look over my charts and lab results he grabbed my hand which caught me off guard and then said sorry to have to tell you this but your hiv results came back positive swear didn even hear the word positive just read his lips that seem to go in slow motion said sorry but there must be some mistake am not sexually active ve only had sex once haven had oral sex or any sexual activity with anyone but one person he said that he would order additional tests and they all came back positive thought about committing suicide could not eat could not sleep could not focus on school couldn do anything but cry my doctor couldn legally tell my mother was hiv positive but was on her insurance so she would find out sooner or later when she saw the co pays for the hiv meds he prescribed and the increased doctor visits tried to get in contact with stephawn but his number was disconnected when got back to school went over to the apartment complex where he lived but couldn remember the apartment number had no way of reaching this guy wanted to kill him and was going to had butcher knife and was going to stab him thru the heart because knew this guy had given me hiv because didn have sex with anyone else as time passed became so depressed that eventually dropped out of school kept thinking what is the purpose of getting degree when going to die soon lost pounds from not eating and started to look very frail decided to drop out of school because didn know how to deal with it all had no one to turn to couldn tell my friends and couldn tell my parents can you imagine telling your mother that you are hiv positive after one night stand couldn dare to see the pain in her eyes of knowing her son is going to die before her today read the article about isaac burks and saw his picture this is the same guy who told me his name was

recently republican ohio gov john kasich vetoed the so called heartbeat bill measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy or before many women even know that they are pregnant at the same time kasich signed bill banning abortion after weeks of pregnancy with exceptions only for saving pregnant woman life or preventing the substantial and irreversible impairment of major bodily function at the risk of sounding discriminatory which is not at all my goal here but at the risk of sounding like that there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions kasich told the ohio daily star women are wonderful beings they are kind loving incredible and whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them but at the end of the day sorry to have to say this but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things the women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex or to get their partners to marry them he continued our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have today the situation is so critical that honestly fear for the future of this country and so was in position to make change and do something important and so did and there one very simple reason why did it that that if woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they re supposed to be closed if she doesn have the foresight to make sure she doesn get herself in situation where she might be pregnant then there is no way woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion woman like that can barely take care of herself and we re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such woman and kill her unborn child being who done no wrong and only exists as its mother mistake do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations to literally force them to commit manslaughter kasich said don know about the rest of the people living in my state but for one am not comfortable with that one bit and so reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening and ll tell you another thing as of recently all cases of out of wedlock pregnancies in the state of ohio will have to be approved by the state that means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn married or at the very least engaged will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental and in the case of the latter the couple will be fined total of with of the fine being charged on the mother to be for not being able to not only use birth control but having sex before marriage in the first place women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open the governor concluded source newslo com

seth rich seth rich editor note we want to update you on story you first saw on fox dc we want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by rod wheeler the private investigator hired by seth rich family whose services are being paid for by third party what he told fox dc on camera monday regarding seth rich murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last hours rod wheeler has since backtracked in an interview monday wheeler told fox dc he had sources at the fbi confirming there was evidence of communication between seth rich and wikileaks this is the verbatim of that exchange fox dc you have sources at the fbi saying that there is information wheeler for sure fox dc that could link seth rich to wikileaks wheeler absolutely yeah that confirmed in the past hours rod wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from fbi sources contradicting what he told us on monday since rod wheeler backtracked tuesday fox dc attempted incessantly to communicate with him but he didn return calls or emails on wednesday just before our newscast wheeler responded to our requests via telephone conversation where he now backtracks his position and wheeler characterizes his on the record and on camera statements as when asked if wheeler is still working for seth rich family wheeler told fox dc the contract still stands ties have not been severed we reached out once again to the rich family and through spokesperson the rich family tells fox dc the family has relayed their deep disappointment with rod wheeler conduct over the last hours and is exploring legal avenues to the family original story it has been almost year since democratic national committee staffer seth rich was murdered in the nation capital there have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now rich was shot and killed last july in northwest and police have suggested the killing in the district bloomingdale neighborhood was botched robbery however online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to rich work at the dnc just two months shy of the one year anniversary of rich death fox has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right rod wheeler private investigator hired by the rich family suggests there is tangible evidence on rich laptop that confirms he was communicating with wikileaks prior to his death wheeler services were offered to the family and paid for by third party according to statement issued by the rich family tuesday which also includes that the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the rich family and paid for by third party and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family now questions have been raised on why police the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months have insisted this was robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that wheeler former police homicide detective is running parallel investigation into rich murder he said he believes there is cover up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation the police department nor the fbi have been forthcoming said wheeler they haven been cooperating at all believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer which believe is either at the police department or either at the fbi have been told both when we asked wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links rich to wikileaks he said absolutely yeah that confirmed wheeler also told us have source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said rod we were told to stand down on this case and can share any information with you now that is highly unusual for murder investigation especially from police department again don think it comes from the chief office but do believe there is correlation between the mayor office and the dnc and that is the information that will come out tuesday wheeler told fox that he will provide us with full report with the new details fox melanie alnwick spoke with police on tuesday and was told that wheeler assertion that source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the rich case was false the family sent alnwick statement on tuesday with the following statement as we ve seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims we see no facts we have seen no evidence we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press even if tomorrow an email was found it is not high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we ve seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so we are family who is committed to facts not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding seth murderers the services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the rich family and paid for by third party and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family previous coverage on the seth rich murder investigation

fresh off his gaffe involving president andrew jackson and the civil war donald trump has made yet another historical faux pas regarding the war of northern aggression in an interview with the red shtick trump regaled us with his other thoughts on the war that an angry jackson totally saw coming trump has been struggling to defend his comments widely deemed preposterous even by st landry parish educational standards in which he claimed man who owned as many as slaves would ve found way to prevent the civil war the donald member of the party of lincoln elaborated on his recent controversial remarks about how the first democratic president who died years before the civil war would have managed to avoid war the first republican president could not trump noted fan of kentucky fried chicken explained how col sanders took five loaves of evangeline maid bread and two chickens added his secret blend of herbs and spices and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter speaking to our intern dave robicheaux who is paid in facebook likes trump insisted col harland sanders whom he called tremendous civil war hero once saved an entire army at valley forge from certain starvation trump noted fan of kentucky fried chicken explained how col sanders took five loaves of evangeline maid bread and two chickens added his secret blend of herbs and spices and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter robicheaux attempted to explain to trump that col sanders was born years after the end of the war that the donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with biblical story about jesus feeding the multitudes and that valley forge was neither an encampment nor battle site during the civil war upon being confronted with these facts the donald abruptly ended his interview with us and he was last seen headed for confederate monument removal protest in new orleans while screaming about fake news church chicken and popeye louisiana kitchen were unavailable for comment incidentally trump has promised to deport every worker at those two companies restaurants if they don share their respective secret recipes with him the red shtick will update this story as new attacks from the white house on history and our deep fried way of life develop what do you think of this shtick

we all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything crawl back to bed under layer of blankets and live there until we feel better we might feel bit guilty but relaxing day in bed sounds awesome even though it luxury which few of us can afford at least we can all fantasize about it if you re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation nasa might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it but it may involve bit more relaxation than you re prepared for nasa has put out an ad looking for people who re willing to take part in their rest studies study which will require participant to spend straight days in bed relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis for which they will receive salary of usd during the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books play games skype and smoke weed they can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed week after week earning cool usd per week so what is the exact purpose of these studies these studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle additionally they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment the rest study is very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel this study is designed to achieve three core tasks examining how the astronauts changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions examining if the astronauts physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose the study participants were divided into two groups exercising and non exercising the exercising group will have to exercise on specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis while the non exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely the entire study will last somewhere between and depending on whether you re in the exercising or non exercising group once the study begins during the initial days non exercising subjects and days exercising subjects you can move around the bed rest area freely in and out of bed but once this period ends for the next days you ll be forbidden from leaving your bed for days you ll have to lie down with your feet up kick back and enjoy you ll get out of bed only for few tests and nothing more days of complete lazing during the study nasa will have to conduct bone muscle and heart tests as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems your nutritional condition and your body immunity system but is it worth it you may not think so at first but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating at some point you may feel like you can take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel this will probably be your only opportunity to say that you ve actually helped send the first astronauts to mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back
nasa will pay you to stay in bed and smoke weed for straight days
here is what will happen if the deep state takes down president trump it not pretty for them the tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants thomas jefferson elder patriot corrupt politicians ignore jefferson directive to their own detriment it no longer political it personal americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of donald trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the freedom movement genie back in the bottle conservative senator ted cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the elections and the expectations of the voters cruz who had the most high profile personality clash with donald trump during the republican primary process nevertheless embraced trump america first agenda and said if we re given the white house and both houses of congress and we don deliver think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets and think quite rightly candidate trump promised many things border control lower taxes fairer trade relations balanced budget healthcare that puts the people first not the government safer communities and to the extent possible an end to foreign wars what among those promises should any republican nay any american have problem with after four months without single legislative achievement congressional and senatorial republicans notably john mccain paul ryan and lindsey graham have joined the democrats in investigating president trump absent single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed so what gives well there was one additional promise that trump made on his way to the white house that has some republicans joining with democrats and quaking in their boots trump promise to drain the swamp as we reported yesterday an agent with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the clinton case told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down the criminal co conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched what can only be characterized as coup attempt democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars it should be noted that the democratic party has already done this once before one hundred and fifty seven years ago the democrats waged war against the first republican president abraham lincoln for giving blacks their freedom that war came at high price as many as americans died fighting for what they believe in to put that in perspective these casualties exceed the nation loss in all its other wars from the revolution through vietnam today americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children god given freedoms despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media they aren the leftwing funded rioters the pussy hat wearing feminists or the cuck bois that cant handle micro aggression no the americans that back donald trump are well armed donald trump presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him that are comprised of the large majority of military voters police and nra members move it forward by force these patriots are armed trained prepared and have proven their discipline they have grown disgusted by the corruption in washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure trump freedom agenda moves forward and under the direction of donald trump himself no amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that the battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results so why are establishment politicians courting bloodbath on the streets of america that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of making america great again it because they have been caught red handed and up to their eyeballs in worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the american taxpayers and now that they ve been caught robbing the world largest bank the treasury they have chosen to go out in blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial washington criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president it time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly buckle your chin strap america is counting on you editors note this is not call to arms but rather an analysis of what would happen if the deep states overturns duely elected president here is list of every single time obama committed an impeachable offense that dems media covered up impeach it been more than eight years since democrats uttered that word long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during president obama administration but now that president trump is the man in the white house it back with vengeance democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the word hoping to nail trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the new york times claimed memo written by former fbi director james comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser michael flynn some members of congress are getting in on the action they include reps maxine water calif and al green texas even republican rep justin amash claimed wednesday there are grounds to impeach president trump house oversign committee chair rep jason chaffetz utah asked for the alleged comey memo and other documents chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information and sen john mccain ariz invoked watergate now the democratic party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as election issue more than million people signed petition calling on congress to impeach trump wasting no time wednesday the mainstream media sprang into action echoing the left impeachment calls msnbc launched watergate ad implying trump is america new richard nixon watergate we know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions says msnbc host chris hayes who hinted that trump is next on the impeachment chopping block now who knows where the questions will take us but know this not going to stop asking them meanwhile some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around washington demanding all white house staffers resign wednesday the posters read if you work for this white house you are complicit in hate mongering lies corrupt taking of americans tax money via self dealing and emoluments and quite possibly federal crimes and treason also any wars will be on your soul resign now but constitutional scholar jonathan turley who voted for president obama warned impeachment enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with president trump why at this time there no evidence trump actually committed crime the criminal code demands more than what comey reportedly describes in his memo turley wrote in may opinion piece posted at the hill turley explained for the first time the comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding trump into the scope of the united states criminal code however if this is food for obstruction of justice it is still an awfully thin soup some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office not surprising within minutes of the new york times report the response was chorus of breathless gotcha announcements but this memo is neither the pentagon papers nor the watergate tapes indeed it raises as many questions for comey as it does trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct good place to start would be with the federal law specifically the criminal code demands more than what comey reportedly describes in his memo there are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors none would fit this case that leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the due administration of justice however that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence corruptly when trump could say that he did little but express concern for longtime associate the term corruptly is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions but it often involves showing that someone acted with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him obama iran nuke deal obama knew about hillary private email server obama irs targets conservatives obama doj spies on ap

the announcement that mall of america was welcoming its first black santa claus was greeted in many quarters as good thing but as might be expected in country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind many were highly offended three years after fox megyn kelly definitively explained to america that both jesus christ and santa claus were white men mall of america dismissed her advice and hired larry jefferson retired army veteran from irving texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors among many who were offended by this move was former half term governor of alaska sarah palin the sharp tongued republican wasted no time in condemning the company actions going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and running mall of america into the ground on the basis of santa always having been white in the bible no refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities thought the company had some backbone but guess was wrong palin told the minneapolis star tribune she also argued that hiring non white santa claus was the last straw in corporate america twisting of traditional conservative christian values because they realized they couldn make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they ve been using so far she added that why they had to come up with something new and out of the box at least something that appeared that way in their minds but this proves that they have no morals and that they won shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional christian values just so they could make more money understand having to make profit in order to get by and have good life but don understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that that why americans especially white ones need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again palin added the holy book always said santa claus was white and any kind of deviation from that regardless of its magnitude is sin and we need to make an example out of mall of america if we don if we let them get away with it what next others will follow their example and the next thing we know we re going to be having arab santa clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make ieds out of christmas lights mean just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip hop music you think that happening by accident nope our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional white christianity the numbers of converts to islam have also spiked just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups we are being bred out people and as innocent as it may seem black santa is just the beginning she concluded

nine years ago driver lost control of his pickup truck and crashed into the confederate monument on the front lawn of the franklin county courthouse decapitating the marble soldier some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised the soldier would be back the rededication ceremony in drew crowd of about people women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of confederate soldiers we re very proud of it says linda stanley managing director of the franklin county historical society in rocky mount virginia miles southeast of roanoke this whole county very very patriotic story continued below this was the way skirmishes over confederate history have often gone history is replaced not rewritten that is until last year when white supremacist dylann roof gunned down nine people at an african american church in charleston south carolina the massacre set off national debate about confederate symbols in public places leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the confederate flag from the south carolina capitol grounds where it had flown for decades but for every nationally publicized debate like the one over south carolina flag there are dozens of smaller battles in places like franklin county and this is especially true in virginia which as the former home to the capital of the confederacy has more confederate monuments than any other state virginia increasingly diverse and progressive embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the new south and the still powerful nostalgia of the old dominion and it drama that is playing out in town squares across the state though quinnipiac university poll last summer found virginians evenly divided on the governor decision to remove the confederate flag from state license plates pride in local monuments remains strong when city leaders in danville on virginia southern border voted to remove confederate flag from the grounds of the sutherlin mansion known as the last capitol of the confederacy confederate struck back they filed lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated arguing that it was part of war memorial and that virginia law protected all war memorials in the state last fall circuit court judge ruled against them that ruling along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state prompted the republican delegate from franklin county to demand in january blanket protection for what has been feature of southern urban landscapes for more than century charles poindexter introduced bill in the general assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments regardless of when they were built if you eliminate these monuments and memorials you re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country to learn the good the bad and ugly poindexter says many of his colleagues in the virginia legislature agreed with him but in march democratic governor terry mcauliffe vetoed the bill saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their confederate monuments based on their individual histories some historians and civic leaders think the debate over confederate symbols in public spaces which began in the will take decades to play out every little statue part of much larger discussion and movement says edward ayers former president of the university of richmond and noted civil war historian african americans now have political voice and this is one of the things that they re using it for mark whitaker remembers walking by the foot tall confederate monument in portsmouth virginia when he was kid shopping at store across the street he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers his parents had told him what it represented my ancestors could not say thing in the face of that indignity whitaker says now as an african american city council member in city that is percent black he wants to remove the monument from the center of olde towne and perhaps put it in cemetery these monuments are really rally and celebration of the rise of an institution that oppressed black people he says many of the confederate monuments were built from the through the an era when civil war veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them it was also the era immediately following reconstruction when federal troops abandoned the south and whites aimed to reassert power through jim crow laws lynchings and groups such as the ku klux klan granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power often in the center of town but even in majority black city on the eastern shore of the state whitaker has battled to get portsmouth monument removed last summer attorney fred taylor who also represented confederate in the danville case warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument we believe the monument protection act covers the monument in danville covers the monument in portsmouth taylor says he argues that the original virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to so there has been protection all along when the circuit court judge ruled against him in danville taylor appealed the case to the virginia supreme court so far the court has not agreed to hear the case back in portsmouth the debate continues some residents don want the city to spend upward of to move the monument position whitaker finds ridiculous why now when we talk about moving symbol of racism we re concerned about cost he says the portsmouth city council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the november elections we re on solid legal grounds to remove it he says we just need four votes other virginia cities have struck middle ground forming committees to figure out what to do with their confederate monuments in may charlottesville convened blue ribbon commission on race memorials and public spaces although the move was sparked by controversial statue of robert lee in public park mayor mike signer was determined to broaden the conversation with an eye toward changing the city entire historic landscape he asked the commission to look at several landmarks from an african american cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of confederate boy in front of the courthouse members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites building new monuments to african american leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected there might even be virtual mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites the goal signer says is to change the narrative of charlottesville by telling the full story of race through our public spaces the commission is slated to give its recommendations to the city council in december in the wealthy heavily democratic city of alexandria similar advisory group decided not to remove the appomattox statue in the middle of old town which depicts defeated confederate soldier with his eyes downcast the united daughters of the confederacy owns the monument and moving it would require approval from the virginia general assembly also as the advisory group noted appomattox is one of the rare confederate statues that marks historic site the place where the th virginia regiment gathered to withdraw from union occupation of the city in the group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down black lives matter is spray painted on monument to former confederate president jefferson davis in richmond virginia in june ap photo richmond the former capital of the confederacy has an entire street lined with monuments to confederate leaders it also majority black city in june someone scrawled black lives matter on the statue of former confederate president jefferson davis yet mayor dwight jones has not called for the monuments removal instead he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders such as the bronze of tennis legend arthur ashe who was born in richmond that the city erected in rather than tearing down we should be building up in ways that establish proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell richer and more accurate story of virginia history jones said in statement last summer delegate poindexter tends to agree with jones although he fuzzy on the specifics asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing confederate monuments he says it far better than tearing down the current ones in his eyes the era in which the confederate monuments were erected is irrelevant they need to be respected he says they didn know what we know today that why these monuments are important ayers says many people who push to preserve confederate monuments share this attitude the white south has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the united states he says they ve taken what ground they can get and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization it an amalgam of power and weakness they re meant to do work ayers says the work that they were meant to do in some ways they re still doing saying that this is place where local white people call the shots in franklin county the power struggle is deeply personal stanley says the area sent about confederate soldiers to what she calls the war between the states veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates beginning in the local chapter of the united daughters of the confederacy started raising money for memorial to honor the sons fathers and husbands who never made it home they dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in one of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was booker washington the famed african american educator who was born into slavery on farm in franklin county in in he wrote letter offering to contribute funds for the confederate memorial in honor of the family that owned him as far as stanley knows washington did contribute some amount we just don have copy of the actual check poindexter says franklin county lost hundreds of its best men in the civil war and for decades afterward reconstruction was horrible process that had big impact on the region today franklin county is home to about people percent of whom are white they elected poindexter conservative christian with an rating from the national rifle association to the general assembly for the first time in in the county had median household income of far below the state median of its residents voted republican in the past three presidential races and many supported poindexter efforts to save war monuments we didn want anybody pulling any monuments down stanley says soon after the county replaced the confederate memorial in front of the courthouse the local chapter of the naacp suggested that statue of booker washington be erected beside it other community leaders wanted to put up pedestal honoring african americans who contributed to the county civil war effort the county board of supervisors tabled their request saying the community needed more time to discuss it civil war memorials are not generally big tourist draw in the roanoke region says landon howard president of visit virginia blue ridge to be candid we really do not get hardly any american civil war visitation here yet locals have their own loyalties every year the franklin county historical society celebrates veterans memorial day honoring all local casualties of military conflicts according to the society website special emphasis is placed on veterans of the war between the states as this war touched literally every household in the county confederate general jubal early was born in franklin county and he known as one of the rebels who never surrendered he became the primary spokesman for the lost cause and became the overwhelming authority on published confederate history says the website of the jubal early homeplace speaking by phone from his farm in franklin county poindexter isn ready to surrender either he doesn know whether he ll propose his monument protection bill again next year but he hasn ruled it out if you start tearing down monuments where do you stop he says you can change what was but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again lisa rab is journalist in charlotte her work has appeared in mother

glenn beck shares buyer remorse on cruz endorsement glenn beck former ted cruz surrogate suggested monday that he have been better off backing marco rubio in the republican presidential primary and laced into the texas senator for throwing his support behind donald trump late last week for the very first time heard ted cruz calculate and when that happened the whole thing fell apart for me and it my fault beck said on his radio show story continued below it my fault beck continued should have said you know who can win you know who could beat hillary clinton marco rubio and disagree with him on the gang of eight and there about percent that do agree with him on and he kind of politician but he different kind of politician he young politician he hispanic he can win let go for it instead beck sought truly honorable man in cruz and that will always let you down he said but while lamenting the fact that cruz chose to be politician friday beck said that he believes the texas firebrand is still good man not gonna condemn him he is still believe good man beck said he is just politician first ve never put him into the category of politician and that my fault he is politician for his part cruz insisted to beck monday that he was trying to show the trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the republican national convention in which he encouraged republicans to vote their conscience in november after beck noted that cruz failed to answer question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president the senator explained that the presidential election is binary choice conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options vote for trump for clinton third party candidate write in candidate or abstain so man who has principles who says there are lines will not cross it still binary choice so man who you cannot come on and say yes glenn he is fit to be president of the united states still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it binary choice beck asked you are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle cruz shot back warning of the damage he said clinton would do to america beck however wasn satisfied this is information that you had in cleveland and hang on just second before you respond you had all of this information you had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that donald trump is sociopathic liar beck said so you had all this information have you spent an enormous amount of time with donald trump do you have new information that has made you say oh my gosh he now not sociopathic liar he is not the guy very eloquently spelled out for over year and now suddenly there reason to believe him despite his significant disagreements with trump cruz said it binary choice asking for new information asking you for new information beck said you knew all the things that you re saying today the time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently why now what new cruz pointed to the trump campaign release of possible conservative supreme court nominees list that includes cruz ally utah sen mike lee he suggested he had hand in the list noting that the supreme court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee mike pence when he asked the texas senator what it would take to get him on board we discussed the supreme court as being one of the great checks protecting the constitution and the rule of law and the trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes cruz said after stu burguiere pressed cruz on why he would believe anything trump says he rattled off series of principles at stake now with respect to the justices donald trump would nominate know that he is publicly committing to nominate from list that is very strong and if he were to nominate from that list it would be major step towards protecting our rights cruz said hope that he would follow through on that commitment one never knows if one will but the fact that he is public promising will nominate from these think creates dynamic where compared to hillary who is promising to put left wing ideologues that clear choice cruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his rnc remarks were swipe against trump adding that he always been never hillary but not ever never trump he also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what ronald reagan said about gerald ford and what ted kennedy said about jimmy carter my speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches cruz said both of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches one of the unfortunate things about the reaction is cleveland is that for many who were watching it was perceived that was essentially embracing never trump have never been never trumper after cruz appearance beck said cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed trump he could have come on and said look guys here the thing my supporters are yelling at me and know that because so are mine he said my donors who are all in with the gop they re all saying ll never fund won fund you for the senate won fund you for the run in and have to make decision so the question is do completely shut myself out of this game or do play the game as much as possibly can authors

on the night of september as the house lights dim in the mack complex at hofstra university and the tv cameras go live millions of americans will be riveted to the scene will donald trump seem well prepared will hillary clinton commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president experience suggests it hard to make positive breakthrough especially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked but what is possible is serious unforced error story continued below over the years that presidential debates have been televised one of their great legacies has been the sudden public gaffe mistake live on tv that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate despite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day the truth is that these are televised performances what the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies every breath they take every expression they make and every emotion they convey can play major role in determining how americans evaluate their performances and although debates don usually transform how most voters think of the candidates they do confirm voters impressions which matters on election day for both candidates this will be particularly big challenge donald trump is larger than life presence who likes to intimidate cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of bounds which could lead to an unforced error by hillary clinton hillary clinton who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show has steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under trump skin instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling if either of these happens it will join the long line of memorable campaign changing moments that candidates fumbled into nixon

makeup applied to his face but that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing knee infection as result he looked peaked video the biggest unforced errors in debate history from richard nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to george bush checking his watch before an audience question here are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in history during their televised rumble nixon could be seen sweating and on camera wiping his brow with handkerchief his pale color and five clock shadow didn help all of which undercut his performance against kennedy who was vision of youthful vigor ford and carter freeze in moment of crisis more dramatic moment occurred on september when the sound system malfunctioned in philadelphia walnut street theater forcing minute delay during the debate during which president gerald ford and then governor jimmy carter awkwardly stood still on stage the broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems neither candidate wanted to move fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home so instead they stood frozen in comic parody better than anything that saturday night live could imagine moderators robert mcneil and jim lehrer kept talking as the candidates stood helplessly like two hollywood stand ins wrote jules witcover in the washington post years later ford admitted that suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system but think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren physically or mentally able to handle problem like this in the end both men were diminished they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights carter grim faced critiques seem too self serious in politics brevity can be virtue during his only debate with ronald reagan in the fall of jimmy carter didn get that lesson in front of record breaking million viewers carter was hoping to paint ronald reagan as creature of the far right someone like barry goldwater the gop nominee whom lyndon johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some years earlier as reagan sought to present himself as more moderate relatable republican carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how reagan had opposed medicare in while carter looked grim on the attack reagan grinned like mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase there you go again he said with laugh the line undercut carter entire argument making reagan look like the bigger man mondale lets reagan one liner negate serious weakness during first debate reagan then aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions he stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement his opponent former vice president walter mondale was crisp and sharp in contrast reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers lou cannon wrote that reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser stu spencer that he had flopped the wall street journal headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist new question in race is oldest president now showing his age fortunately for reagan he came back with vengeance in later debate when baltimore sun journalist henry trewitt asked reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency reagan had quip for the ages will not make age an issue in this campaign will not exploit for political purposes my opponent youth and inexperience the audience erupted in laughter including mondale which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge dukakis seems cold in the face of deeply personal question perhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by cnn anchor bernard shaw to massachusetts gov michael dukakis at the second debate of dukakis was widely seen as technocrat man whose inner character remained mystery to many voters the night before the debate at shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate and so he began the debate with it governor if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer reporters were shocked but dukakis seemed unperturbed in clinical and dispassionate manner dukakis simply said no don bernard and think you know that ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life don see any evidence that it deterrent and think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime it was as though dukakis was talking about stranger answering in the same tone that professor might use to explain basic point of fact in the classroom voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have it was question about dukakis values and emotions his campaign director susan estrich later recalled when he answered by talking policy knew we lost the election bush checks his watch while an audience member asks question during the campaign few moments were more devastating to george bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of town hall debate with bill clinton and ross perot right before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average americans bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left only more minutes of this crap bush would later say he was thinking at the time checking the time would ve been unflattering in normal debate setup but coming as it did during debate in which ordinary americans posed questions to the presidential candidates it seemed like bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say for candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him gore sighs eye rolls and miscalculates in confrontation with bush entering the debates in vice president al gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against political lightweight in george bush gore had been in high profile debates before and his team was confident that the debates would show american voters that bush relative lightweight known to stumble over his words lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president during the first debate gore overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with bush backfired big time at several points microphones caught gore loudly sighing in response to bush answers which played into republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending and as bush criticized the democrat plans for their fuzzy math gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration at the third debate town hall style affair one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened gore walked right up to bush as he was speaking as if to physically intimidate him looking up with an annoyed glance bush seized the moment nodding his head with smirk and continuing on with his statement making gore action look odd as the audience laughed donna brazile who ran gore campaign believed that gore won the debates on policy but on mannerisms and the takeaway he ended up losing many of us remember the split screen and al gore was sitting there rolling his eyes perhaps looking at george bush and basically he started to sigh bush cannot contain his irritation at kerry after the first debate of the general election in president bush came under criticism when he couldn contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent senator john kerry made about bush record though bush had benefited from the visuals of his debates against vice president al gore the critics weren so kind to bush in when cameras caught him scowling clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern as he listened to kerry speak the democratic national committee didn wait long to pounce on the president in their online video faces of frustration viewers were treated to repeat of the split screen showing kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with bush angry looks on the right side appearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates of course what the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media while the quality of the one line zingers particularly in the viral age of twitter facebook and youtube are important in shaping perceptions of the event

donald trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country the city of new york recently ended stop and frisk but trump is pushing for it apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate former new york city mayor rudy giuliani from politico in pre taped interview on fox news scheduled to air wednesday night trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address violence in the black community and black on black crime trump responded by proposing that stop and frisk policing in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband be adopted nationwide would do stop and frisk think you have to we did it in new york it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and you know you really help people sort of change their mind automatically trump told the questioner stop and frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by new york city residents because the policy was shown time and time again to target black and latino residents they were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers in what some felt were quotas set up by police management when the city stopped using stop and frisk they did not see an increase in crime despite claims from its supporters that there would be spike in criminal activity most people who had been subject to stop and frisk were let go because they hadn done anything wrong former us district court judge shira scheindlin who had ruled the procedure in federal court described it as destructive in an interview with buzzfeed she added in short the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it featured image via flickr

ap photo backtalk robert kennedy would have hated donald trump the gop candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be writing as former legislative assistant to senator robert kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of hillary clinton for president was disappointed to see in politico the screed written by my former colleague adam walinsky excoriating clinton record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that donald trump should therefore be elected president it is one thing to disagree with secretary clinton which walinsky does heatedly and quite another to turn to donald trump we should be clear that walinsky critique is not confined to clinton he lays out and massively overstates dark view not just of clinton but also of president obama and almost the entire democratic party the analysis is overwrought but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is trump story continued below the question is not whether there is military industrial complex in our country president eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it the st century version begins with the iraq war which was originated by republican president am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that presidents obama clinton and carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways the question here is whether donald trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot walinsky finds in trump rationality and consistency that do not exist any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with nato and other allies at another he will lash out at any perceived insult to the or to himself and pledges that america pride needs to be vindicated militarily america first trump says regularly bringing the isolationism of charles lindbergh to mind before excoriating president obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has secret plan to obliterate the islamic state to compare john kennedy and robert kennedy to donald trump is well won finish the sentence yes robert kennedy turned against the vietnam war but not because he felt that america should retreat from the world he opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on flawed notion of american interests the result as we know was the death of vietnamese and americans and others who should not have died jfk and rfk were they understood that world war ii left the united states with responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world they understood that america must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue peaceful world they understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk they made those difficult often excruciating decisions carefully and as transparently as possible never rashly impulsively or vindictively walinsky quotes robert kennedy statement that if any member of the excomm other than john kennedy had been president during the cuban missile crisis we would have had nuclear war ask yourself what president trump might have done in that moment restraint is not the word that comes to mind this is man who said he would order the military to kill the families of muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the united states should have seized iraq oil resources as spoils to the victor yes we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors but electing donald trump is not the answer it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways the answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither american security interests nor egregious human rights violations topic in which donald trump has shown an ostentatious indifference as his fondness for vladimir putin reflects all the evidence provided again and again by donald trump own mouth tells us not that he is man of peace but that he is man of no principle man who will say and possibly do whatever happens to cross his mind at given minute he is like the weather in new england if you don like it wait minute we do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes we do not know what he knows because from all we can see he does not know much even if walinsky diatribe is correct which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth there is nothing in it that justifies turning to donald trump of all occasions to break ranks with the democratic party this is the most inappropriate of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of john and robert kennedy two of our greatest public servants this is the most egregious have ever seen to say that am disappointed by what walinsky has done is an understatement america in this election faces an existential question and history will judge us by our answer walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle peter edelman is the carmack waterhouse professor of law and public policy at georgetown university law center
robert kennedy would have hated donald trump
billionaire who built up corporate empire from his father inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after long period of stagnation but in this case it not donald trump it jim justice the democratic candidate for governor in west virginia and coal baron to boot like trump justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself and like trump justice is running nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern eschewing hillary clinton and barack obama in favor of cult of personality based around his exploits in business as west virginia only billionaire he can self fund pumping million into his campaign through mid june justice faces stiff crosswinds however running as down ballot democrat in one of trump strongest states story continued below west virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate but metronews west virginia poll released earlier this month showed trump with advantage over hillary clinton who won only percent to bernie sanders percent in the state may primary in an era of declining split ticket voting justice must outperform clinton by double digits to win that led to dynamic in which west virginia gop candidate for governor state senate president bill cole is embracing trump while justice is distancing himself from clinton it very nearly the opposite of what happening in other states with close races across the nation democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use trump as weapon in this race it pretty clear democrats are trying to localize because trump is not drag but an asset for cole says kyle kondik managing editor of larry sabato crystal ball at the university of virginia center for politics this is one of the few places in the country where republicans are more concerned with nationalizing race than democrats are in this race trump isn drag on republicans he an asset the reason is simple coal republicans have dominated appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning democrats with war on coal rhetoric blaming obama for the industry decline it hard to make that charge stick against coal baron and justice definitely qualifies he inherited an array of coal interests from his father then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the east that growth included the sale of his bluestone coal corp to russia oao mechel for million then the coal slump hit and last year justice bought bluestone back for million less than percent of his selling price cole the republican candidate has more elective experience than justice but he no establishment insider owner of bill cole automall and other businesses cole is finishing only his first term in the west virginia senate having previously served few months in the house of delegates when he was appointed to fill vacant seat however cole spent much of wrapped up in state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried and true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes banning late term abortions and opening charter schools in year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy that may not be enough even in republican tilting state with wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket if you think about the primary races here we saw giant trump win and giant sanders win says scott crichlow associate professor of political science at west virginia university if you look at trump look at sanders look at justice they certainly have policies that are known the wall universal health care the coal industry but so much of what driving the appeal for them is personality and image not just list of policy prescriptions justice is running as conservative democrat not unlike former governor and current sen joe manchin with whom he shares number of campaign staff he flip flopped between the two major parties giving money to both and changing his registration most recently in february when he became democrat however he says he won vote for clinton and dismissed cole claim that he supports obama as complete dog snot and while justice spokesman grant herring says his candidate isn focused on the national political circus the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar jim is no politician says herring he is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state at the moment it looks like that approach is working metronews west virginia poll released september showed justice running away with the race at percent cole with percent mountain party candidate charlotte pritt with percent and libertarian david moran with percent many doubt the veracity of the metronews poll which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years but most including cole spokesman kent gates agree that justice is winning do think justice has lead yes says gates do think it double digits no some of that is because justice industry ties largely make him resistant to the gop otherwise effective war on coal messaging which has proven to be democrat kryptonite around appalachia even in districts beyond the coalfields if you re going to win in west virginia you better be running against hillary clinton says dave mudcat saunders western virginia political consultant known for his so called bubba strategy designed to help democrats appeal to white working class voters saunders who has said he voting for trump says voters don trust clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else she said she going to put coal out of business west virginia coal miners don want handout they want their dignity they want their jobs if you re going to win in west virginia you better be running against hillary clinton says one democratic strategist but saunders doesn have kind words for justice either he screwed every coal operator in west virginia at one time or another cole sees that reputation as his big opening his spokesman gates says the republican campaign will open up attacks on justice business record over the next several weeks jim justice is coal operator but he not coal operator acting in the best interest of west virginia gates says his legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land that record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states in series on delinquent mines npr reported that justice stands out among mining operators owing nearly million in unpaid fines at the time that same year federal agency issued cessation orders against three justice companies for reclamation violations at tennessee mines including hiring contractor who planted trees upside down the problems have persisted this year in kentucky justice mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly million in delinquent property taxes that an improvement from last year when he owed million in unpaid kentucky taxes in southwest virginia tazewell county officials seized machinery tools and other equipment from justice owned mine this spring to make up for in unpaid property taxes when west virginia property taxes became delinquent in april justice owed more than million the pattern apparently extends to justice other businesses as well two companies sued the greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the pga tournament eventually settling out of court justice mining record which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining as well as his issues with mine reclamation has made him the target of many an appalachian environmental activist the cole campaign going negative on justice might not push those green voters to vote republican but it might tip them toward pritt who is running for governor as the candidate of the mountain party the west virginia affiliate of the green party pritt served eight years in the state legislature and is making her third run for governor the last time she ran in she defeated manchin in primary on the way to loss in the general election both cole and justice have promised to bring back coal jobs but whoever wins in november faces the monumental task of state economy that suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry according to the census west virginia median household income was compared with nationally its poverty rate was percent versus nationally mining jobs have plummeted falling percent in the past calendar year percent from decade ago and percent from when the market for metallurgical or steel making coal spiked on the strength of then strong asian economy mines sit idle as string of industry giants alpha natural resources arch coal patriot coal peabody energy and walter energy filed for bankruptcy due to convergence of factors including slumping asian economy competition from cheap natural gas and federal clean air regulations that resulted in wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas while the market for metallurgical or steel making coal may eventually return it unlikely the same will be true for steam or power producing coal the coal industry struggles haven just hurt west virginia employment rate but also its state budget the reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots in this gubernatorial campaign neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward justice however has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery he previously owned wintergreen resort in virginia before selling it last year and in he bought the famed greenbrier resort out of bankruptcy since then he brought an annual pga tournament and the new orleans saints training camp to the greenbrier in late june month and half after justice won the democratic nomination and two weeks before the greenbrier classic pga tournament was scheduled to start tragedy inadvertently threw spotlight on the greenbrier and the communities around it when west virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as year event in parts of the state twenty three people were killed including in greenbrier county and hundreds of homes were destroyed justice canceled the pga event and closed the greenbrier resort though it opened its doors free of charge to house about people who had been displaced from their homes he shut down his campaign for roughly days following the flooding appearing only at brief press conference to announce the greenbrier reopening date should he win in november however his response to the flooding and actions at the greenbrier will be remembered as defining moment whether justice will win however remains an open question double digit poll lead notwithstanding sabato crystal ball recently moved the west virginia governor race from leans republican to toss up we re being cautious because of the fact that justice will need to run so far ahead of clinton kondik says trump will easily win west virginia but the winner of the governor race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets and whether democrats remain loyal to their party or break for pritt that why cole campaign is attacking justice on his record as coal businessman even as they decry the federal war on coal whether those voters go to cole or to pritt ultimately doesn matter so long as they re not voting for justice in his attacks on justice cole spokesman gates repeated one line couple of times at the end of the day jim justice is going to do what best for jim justice that line has been used about donald trump too the question for west virginia voters on election day will be whether what in justice and trump best interests is in theirs too mason adams writes from southwest virginia he on twitter at masonatoms
is west virginia holding america weirdest election
if hadn seen the last fifteen months of this campaign have no problem in asserting who won this first debate on monday night it was hillary clinton whether the issue was the way she looked on stage or got the better of donald trump in most exchanges or her calm somewhat more presidential demeanor so what my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner it has to do with trump not failing badly he did not show himself to be unfit for the presidency which was clinton main accusation against him in the countless other occasions from his announcement speech on the ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that trump campaign was wounded crippled dead his supporters and every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thought do not hear him the way those of us who ve covered campaigns do the insults the sneers that just shows he the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites the establishment the people who have ignored us ridiculed us left us behind and what of his lack of knowledge demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on monday night it doesn matter because he got the right instincts to upend corrupt system story continued below if he blustery self confident to the point of arrogance dismissive of subtleties then that sign that he bold fearless advocate as he showed again monday night measured by that standard did anything in this debate suggest that he is unfit for the job as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional republicans have argued clinton did bring up the gop national security experts who have rejected him but trump simply replied by citing list of high ranking military officers who are supporting him and what of other standard measure atmospherics she was clearly happier to be on stage than he was his water consumption suggested subtle marco rubio impersonation demeanor it hard to imagine any of those wavering college educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing on the respective vulnerabilities he launched one brief attack on her emails and then the issue went away by contrast she laid down attack after attack on his taxes his business ethics his treatment of women and the birther issue which he linked to outright racism and his defenses that he took advantage of the laws of the nation in his dealings with contractors in his explanation of his missing taxes were somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent it telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime when he argued that the people that are most affected by what happening are african american and hispanic people and it very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen moreover her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks calling his birther argument flat out racist charging he stiffed many of those who worked for him she managed more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father middle class draper never worked for trump finally at the very end of the debate moderator lester holt confronted trump with his statement that clinton did not have the look of president clear implication that this was matter of gender when trump tried to shift the ground to question of stamina smiling clinton was ready well she said as soon as he travels to countries and negotiates peace deal cease fire release of dissidents an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends hours testifying in front of congressional committee he can talk to me about stamina that worked very well have little doubt that clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate by any traditional measure she was but if this campaign so far has proven anything it that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened and very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate jeff greenfield is five time emmy winning network television analyst and author

shares share this story once again donald trump and the republican party fear mongering about immigrants is proven false ever since an improvised explosive device injured in chelsea new york city trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points vilifying syrian refugees these attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country yelled trump at one of his notorious hate rallies on september th he later went on fox news and in one broad stroke painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole think of it hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are you know they have such hatred and sickness in their heart it sickness and it hatred and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in in fact mr trump the truth is the bombing was committed by naturalized american citizen and authorities caught the suspect thanks to sikh immigrant harinder bains he is the owner of the bar in whose doorway ahmad rahami decided to take nap in when bains saw the man face on cnn he did what any responsible citizen would do he called the cops did what think every american would have done my neighbor would have done the same thing any jewish christian sikh muslim anybody would have done the same thing from sikh faith ve been taught always stand up against the atrocities any kind of persecution said bains to cnn chris cuomo he absolutely right because our nation is nation of immigrants all of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples nobody has any more or less of right to be here than everyone else and picking on syrian refugees because they re muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from syria paltry number of the milion syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the syrian civil war none of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the united states the chance of being killed by refugee in terrorist attack is in billion you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms mr bains actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets when immigrants feel accepted by community it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would for instance the orlando shooter was reported to the fbi by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of mateen radicalization racist trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground mr trump and his campaign racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger he is the real threat to america not refugee or immigrants add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president crimes impeach donald trump

holds the saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy pig stomach filled with pork herbs bratwurst and diced potatoes trump may have captured large swath of the american electorate with his signature blend of populism nativism and brazenness and yet in the hometown of his forefather he remains distinctly unpopular in fact few politicians are less popular in germany than trump study by the pew research center found out that only percent of the country finds him trustworthy since local newspaper discovered that johannes steiniger member of the german parliament was distantly related to trump the year old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate with his statements about gay people and foreigners or with the language he uses and with his derogative statements about hillary clinton trump seems to do everything he can so that we get negative image of him steiniger tells politico trump rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities

march previous generations of the trump family used variant spellings of the name including trump dromb and trumpff according to local historians or even drumpf according to family history by gwenda blair but by the time friedrich was born they had settled on trump germany did not yet exist as nation kallstadt was part of the province of palatinate in the bavarian kingdom the region was going though rough times unemployment was high those who had the courage left friedrich father died when he was eight years old and his mother struggled to make ends meet at years old friedrich decided to follow his sister katharina who had emigrated to the united states two years earlier he arrived in new york on board the eider on october he entered the through official channels but he had left bavaria illegally both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service said roland paul the recently retired director of the institute for palatinate regional history and folklife studies in the city of kaiserslautern according to documents uncovered by paul friedrich was stripped of his bavarian citizenship as his own request four years after arriving in the but friedrich was not done with palatinate seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister according to the family history by blair five years after that he returned once more to kallstadt where he met year old elisabeth christ they were engaged and friedrich came back third time to marry her in august but while the couple moved back to new york soon after the marriage and had daughter friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the and return to the land of their birth my grandmother said will marry you but will not go back to america with you donald trump american born cousin john walter told german filmmaker simone wendel in friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise in he applied for permission to travel to kallstadt and although he claimed in his application that he intended to return to the united states within year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein he took all his savings from the with him according to blair family history back in kallstadt friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back but though he secured the support of local authorities the district government put halt to his plans on february deportation notice was sent to the town office of kallstadt declaring that friedrich was to be told he has to leave bavarian state territory by may of this year at the latest friedrich was able to obtain three month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill but eventually he and his wife pregnant once more had no choice but to board the ship pennsylvania on july and return to new york shortly after that donald father fred trump junior was born the authorities said you are not german citizen you gave up your citizenship you have to leave says walter so they left and they went back to america and that why donald and are here friedrich now named frederick died in may of the spanish flu his widow survived her first husband by years and visited kallstadt many times during her

most famous sons of her tiny hometown donald trump and henry john heinz the inventor of heinz ketchup for months wendel had tried to arrange meeting with trump but his office had not replied to her letters she was only able to secure visit with the help of walter trump cousin who had visited kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history on the day of her visit wendel stood nervously next to walter in conference room on one of trump tower top floors she had brought linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw on tops her plan was to sit down with walter and trump for coffee and cake the traditional afternoon snack in her home region but when she asked trump staff to make some coffee the only reaction she got was irritated faces his assistant just couldn be bothered she says hello john trump said when he entered the room shaking his cousin hand and looking confused at wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her trump sat down in front of one meter long model of his boeing airliner and panoramic window overlooking new york central park wendel trying to remedy the situation pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it afterwards just kept on thinking what on earth did do she says the cake looks really good trump said and he and wendel ended up talking for almost an hour until trump still claimed his family was swedish version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti german sentiment in the during the two world wars but by the time wendel visited he had become proud of his german roots they grow them well in kallstadt he told her during their meeting they grow them very well believe me it good stock wow it beautiful trump said when she handed him picture of the house where his grandfather was born an inconspicuous one story building with gable roof that fantastic see how well maintained it is everything is perfectly maintained it

new york cnn hillary clinton and donald trump both met with world leaders in town for the united nations general assembly on monday but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals both clinton and trump met with egyptian president abdel fattah el sisi monday as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks clinton who served for four years as president barack obama secretary of state also met with japanese prime minister shinzo abe and ukrainian president petro poroshenko while the stakes are high for both candidates there is likely more on the line for trump who as foreign policy novice is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next monday trump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief the key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting hoping that voters see president as they observe him with world leader will say that with all the folks being in new york ve had lot of calls from lot of different people on the basis that doing well and you know they seem to think it important to maybe meet trump said monday on fox news don want to comment specifically on who but couple of people are coming over he later said ve already met with couple but refused to say which ones clinton used the meetings with the three world leaders in contrast to stress her facility with high level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct us foreign policy as president clinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader according to aides in the room clinton touched on north korea and the rise of china with japan abe while clinton addressing the need for more vibrant and free civil society with egypt while she met with sisi while reporters were in the room clinton told sisi that she looked forward to talking about the path we are taking in order to build up new civil society new modern country that upholds the rule of law that respects human rights and liberties trump also met with sisi on monday evening in new york where the two discussed the strategic bilateral relationship between the us and egypt according to trump campaign statement after the meeting sen jeff sessions of alabama and lt gen michael flynn ret two of trump top foreign policy advisers joined trump for the meeting mr trump expressed to president el sisi his strong support for egypt war on terrorism and how under trump administration the united states of america will be loyal friend not simply an ally that egypt can count on in the days and years ahead the trump campaign said the republican nominee who has faced widespread condemnation in the muslim world for his proposal to ban muslims from the and his blanket statements about islam also shared his high regard for peace loving muslims the campaign added the campaign also said trump called the us egypt relationship vital to help promote peace and stability in the middle east sisi is the second foreign leader trump has met with since becoming the republican nominee he first met with the mexican president in mexico last month sitting with poroshenko clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges ukraine faces primarily the very real problems and threats from russian aggression clinton added that she was anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts clinton meetings were announced before trump and senior advisor to the former top diplomat said friday that they were less about furthering political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the white house if she is elected she wants to be sure she is prepared not only to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on day one said senior clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views while she has remained candidate she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins the meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose challenge for trump given clinton lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady trump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before taking trip last month to meet mexican president enrique pe nieto earlier this year the meeting ended awkwardly after trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall but pe nieto said he told trump during the meeting that mexico would not pay for it clinton campaign seized on the public back and forth between the mexican leader and trump with the democratic nominee calling it trump embarrassing international incident when you see that he can even go to foreign country without getting into public feud with the president think the answer is clear donald trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief clinton told voters in ohio after the meeting for her part clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as candidate because her aides feel she doesn need to burnish her foreign policy credentials instead she ll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights and try to score political points clinton meeting with poroshenko in the eyes of her aides attempted to highlight the differences between the democratic and republican nominee on policy toward moscow clinton campaign and other democrats have accused trump of cozying up to putin who has built his foreign policy on thwarting us goals and failing to confront moscow over its annexation of crimea in ukraine clinton adviser said that she believed that washington needed to do more to stand up to russian aggression in ukraine and to allow the kiev government to defend itself currently the obama administration has offered logistical help to ukraine armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some republicans have championed the official did not say however whether clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take look at any requests from the ukrainians clinton meeting with sisi will make waves in the middle east because of the recent estrangement between the egyptian president government and the obama administration clinton according to an aide in the room emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to egypt future progress and discussed ways to deepen cooperation particularly in the fight against isis clinton also used the meeting to call for the release of us citizen aya hijazi who has been imprisoned in egypt since after operating non profit in the country clinton adviser cautioned that the meeting on monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards egypt but nevertheless the official said clinton does understand the complexity and complications of us relations with egypt nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the middle east is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at israeli palestinian peace sisi assumed power following coup against the elected muslim brotherhood government in egypt in clinton had been secretary of state when the us helped push egypt longtime strongman hosni mubarak from power after popular uprising but was seen as less pro active than other members of obama cabinet in cutting loose crucial long standing us ally there are lot of things that the sisi government is doing that are concerning the official said trump positions on foreign policy among them on egypt are more opaque than those of clinton but in his terrorism speech in august he vowed to work with leaders in the middle east including sisi who recognize that this ideology of death must be extinguished clinton meeting with abe comes at time of increased tensions in asia following north korea latest nuclear weapons test the meeting will likely highlight clinton commitment to us alliances in japan and south korea and the us belief that it is up to china to do more to convince its ally in pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path clinton according to an aide discussed the threat from north korea and relations with china during the meeting and abe brought up the trans pacific partnership massive country trade deal that the japanese prime minister has backed and clinton has rejected there is significant concern among us allies the region about the prospect of trump presidency not least because the gop nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep us forces in their countries and raised the possibility that pyongyang growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons step neither nation wants to take

washington since we last updated the cnn battleground map donald trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states the republican nominee has also upped his game as have his allied outside group friends with television ad spending and yet hillary clinton maintains her advantage on the road to when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency with four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under weeks before all the votes are cast hillary clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest cnn outlook when you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning clinton way she has electoral votes in her column in our new estimate hear cnn political director david chalian explain the new race ratings in his podast what changed iowa moves from from battleground to lean republican utah moves from lean republican to solid republican maine nd congressional district moves from solid democrat to battleground nebraska nd congressional district moves from solid republican to battleground road to electoral college map note the split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines the state of play donald trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to iowa state barack obama won twice and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss up battleground category into the lean republican category giving trump total of electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor that leaves electoral votes up for grabs across four states plus two congressional districts florida nevada ohio and north carolina maine and nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results both maine and nebraska second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate maine second congressional district has moved from solid democrat to battleground and nebraska second congressional district has moved from solid republican to battleground providing an opportunity for candidate to pick up single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory finally utah moves back from leaning republican to being solidly being in trump column there is no doubt that trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states but clinton firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes trump path to electoral votes still quite challenging for all of the endless talk about florida ohio and north carolina it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on clinton performance in the states that are leaning her way but not solidly in her camp pennsylvania colorado michigan and virginia are the core of clinton current stronger and more viable path to if trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue leaning states that will set off some alarm bells at her brooklyn hq and suggest more viable path for trump it is not enough for trump to simply win the remaining electoral votes in the battleground states that only gets him to he still needs to chip away at clinton democratic leaning firewall that why we see both trump and clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to pennsylvania for example and that why clinton and pro clinton forces spent more than million on television ads in the keystone state compared to the million we ve seen from trump and pro trump forces in fact pennsylvania is the state with the third highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle behind only florida and ohio clinton and trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of floridians and ohioans but until and unless trump can put one of those democratic leaning states back on the board as battleground or even make one lean his way clinton electoral college advantage holds solid republican alabama alaska arkansas idaho indiana kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri montana nebraska north dakota oklahoma south carolina south dakota tennessee texas utah west virginia wyoming total leans republican arizona georgia iowa total battleground states florida nevada ohio maine nd congressional district nebraska nd congressional district north carolina total leans democratic colorado michigan new hampshire pennsylvania virginia wisconsin total solid democratic california connecticut delaware dc hawaii illinois maine maryland massachusetts new jersey new york oregon rhode island vermont washington minnesota new mexico total

cnn north korea went on the offensive friday blasting the us for aggression in asia blaming washington for its pursuit of nuclear weapons and threatening the us with tremendous consequences beyond imagination the democratic people republic of korea had no other choice but to go nuclear foreign minister ri yong ho told the un general assembly to defend itself from the constant nuclear threats from the united states ri comments came as the us and asian nations gathered in new york friday with fresh reminder of what they consider the gravest threat facing the region north korea announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet the test tuesday was followed by us show of force as the pentagon on wednesday flew two bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating north and south korea setting the the stage for us south korea joint military exercises in october that will include simulated nuclear facility strike the heightened tensions north korea steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the pentagon on notice north korea unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland gen joseph dunford chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said wednesday in maryland it consumed an awful lot of time think it fair to say of senior leadership time over the past few weeks the north korean minister offered through the looking glass version of the same events only couple of days ago the united states has again threatened the dprk by flying the strategic bombers over the military demarcation line on the korean peninsula and landing in south korea ri said we will never remain onlookers at it and the united states will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination meanwhile secretary of state john kerry met friday on the sidelines of the un general assembly with foreign ministers from the association of southeast asian nations member bloc dedicated to economic political and security cooperation the united states will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies kerry told the asean meeting he called on allies to vigorously enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged asean members to ensure that the dprk pays price for its dangerous actions japanese prime minister shinzo abe made blunt call for international action at the un wednesday right before our eyes north korea is carrying out plan about which there can be no doubt abe said there is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now the perceived threat is changing regional dynamics bringing old rivals japan and south korea closer together it putting china on the spot as washington pushes beijing to do more to rein its ally in even as tensions over the south china sea complicate cooperation and it will likely prompt new international push for tougher sanctions the likes of which were used to force iran to the negotiating table that still unlikely to stop north korea formally known as the democratic people republic of korea experts said indeed us officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early october from north korea perspective it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until there substantial shift in dialogue with the us said alison evans country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm ihs for north korea it the recognition that the important thing it needs its status as nuclear power to be recognized evans said adding that the leadership sees developing nuclear deterrent as guarantor of survival us officials say the pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test meanwhile the union of concerned scientists said there is some speculation that pyongyang may try another satellite launch around october the anniversary of the founding of its worker party of korea north korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in january in the ensuing months it has followed that detonation with total of ballistic missile tests including land and submarine based launches in may north korea year old leader kim jong un made the country ambitions official announcing that pyongyang was on dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy just watched us bombers fly over south korea replay more videos must watch us bombers fly over south korea pyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on september the anniversary of the dprk founding in and tuesday rocket launch was substantially larger and more powerful than anything north korea has tested before according to north program devoted to analyzing north korea at johns hopkins university school of advanced international studies all this testing is unlikely to win it the us recognition it craves though after the more recent nuclear test president barack obama made clear that the united states does not and never will accept north korea as nuclear state obama said that the us would work with asian allies the un security council and international partners to implement existing measures and take additional significant steps including new sanctions to demonstrate to north korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions however the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is constant reminder that obama administration will soon no longer calling the american shots on the issue republican presidential nominee donald trump has held out the possibility of meeting with kim in dramatic break with us political conventions he earned criticism for the remark as well as for suggesting that south korea and japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons at some point we have to say you know what we re better off if japan protects itself against this maniac in north korea trump told anderson cooper at cnn town hall in milwaukee in march we re better off frankly if south korea is going to start to protect itself the statements have rattled tokyo and seoul and while trump has said that china must play stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally his promise to play tough with beijing on trade could also roil that effort the republican candidate tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding american policy in the region and is likely to be something that us officials are asked to address in their

sanctions international sanctions levied in march after the january nuclear test were the first on north korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite they ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country among other steps the international community could squeeze north korea further by targeting the export of its resources said

never has the rights for me but not for thee idea been more apparent than in the context of gun control politicians love to parade around with families of mass shooting victims particularly if those victims were schoolchildren they talk about how no one needs ten bullets to kill deer and they talk about how semi automatic rifles especially the black ones serve no purpose other than to kill bunch of people in short amount of time the only kind of gun they don seem to have problem with is shotgun as long as it one that holds no more than two rounds at time while these same politicians use shooting victims to push their anti gun ideas everyone knows that they are surrounded by armed bodyguards yes armed with evil guns donald trump brought this up at campaign rally in miami florida he said she very much against the second amendment she wants to destroy your second amendment guns guns guns right think what we should do is she goes around with armed bodyguards like you have never seen before think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons they should disarm right right think they should disarm immediately what do you think yes take their guns away she doesn want guns let see what happens to her it would be very dangerous every gun control politician benefits from the second amendment the high profile ones surround themselves with security personnel who carry firearms they know that having armed security around them protects them but they don want everyday americans to be afforded the same right for now maybe these gun control politicians would say that they be okay if americans had shotgun at home as long as that gun was locked up in safe and completely disassembled and the ammo was in an entirely different safe on the other side of the house the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

as my th wedding anniversary approached tried to be creative in buying gifts for my wife had the idea of silver coin that marked years of something or other went to local coin shop and as idled over some of the display cases noticed set of coins from the mid th century oddly the coins from the and were large up until when the coins started becoming at best half the size of the others oh the panic of the owner said when asked him about the change of size it was really bad the president didn seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins story continued below now that is inept presidential decision making during the current election campaign there has been lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that whoever the winner is he or she will be so terrible as leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence and before the current candidates were known the two most recent white house occupants barack obama and george bush have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country but obama and bush can both take heart and donald trump and hillary clinton can gain solace perhaps from knowing that no matter how badly they do they almost certainly won rank last by my reckoning that place belongs to james buchanan genial man though he was ve made quite study of him my innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at let say the lesser presidents my father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with biography of franklin pierce everywhere we went he forced me to read historical plaques stopping the car in shrieking halt at times to view them if were to write book about president it surely wouldn be about washington or lincoln or even silent cal coolidge it would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible buchanan the only president from my native state pennsylvania turned out to be my man start with his anemic minimalist solution to one of america great financial downturns for long time before buchanan in effect precipitated the panic of things were going well for the country at least in an economic sense there had been bad downturn years before with multiple causes like war in europe the dissolution of the bank of the united states and overspeculation in oddly enough slaves and western land the great acquisition of land under president james knox polk from oregon to california to texas reinvigorated the economy and boom lasted for the next two decades railroads were the big player since so many people wanted to move west into the new territories and states manufacturing boomed domestically and then with foreign trade as well since europe had quelled many of its hostilities and american items were cheaper than those on the continent then the day before buchanan took office congress passed what he wanted the tariff bill of which lowered tariffs on panoply of items from abroad buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade but made american manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive three days later came the real fatal blow though the dred scott supreme court decision which fell on the shoulders of buchanan the case had wound through state and federal courts for at least decade but roger taney the supreme court chief justice and fellow alumnus with buchanan of small dickinson college wanted it settled scott was slave to military man who at times was stationed not in his native missouri slave state but in the northwest territories which were nonslave after his master died scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory buchanan wanted to be hero and thought if the case could be decided broadly it could settle the question of slavery in the union for good buchanan knew too though that the court had five southerners and four northerners and if the decision were split that way it would be ineffective he and taney had apparently agreed to have narrower decision or remand the case back to the appeals court if it were merely sectional since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate ignoring the idea of separation of powers though buchanan browbeat robert cooper grier another dickinson alumnus and justice from pennsylvania to go along with the majority opinion which taney would write eventually new york native justice samuel nelson wrote concurring opinion making the vote even less sectional legend has it that taney on the capitol stairs just before he gave buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration told buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that and that he would be all for whatever the court decided two days later the decision came down taney castigated scott whom he said was not citizen being slave and thus could not bring any suit he also wrote that the constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or conversely prohibit slavery thus all the compromises about it going back to the were invalid and in fact the fugitive slave law requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country was in force historically experts rate dred scott as the worst decision in the court history but short of that it was at the very least for the country with not just taney but surely buchanan responsible for it as appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time there was practical downside too now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go west to use the railroads or to start business that railroads might profit from railroad stocks started to decline in value and then contagion hit and it was free fall by midsummer no one could take ride on the reading as uncle pennybags does in the monopoly game since the reading railroad had shut down as did lines now and then famous like the illinois central several lines like the delaware lackawanna and western and the fond du lac railroad in wisconsin declared bankruptcy thousands were thrown out of work and banks started foreclosing on loans and property senator william seward the leader of the new republican party come home from vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned his stock in the illinois central promoted to him by his rival democrat stephen douglas was virtually worthless every bank in new york city effectively closed none would convert coins or gold into bank notes the oldest grain company in new york wolfe and co failed in august as did the most prominent insurance business in the country the ohio life insurance and trust co buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria calm words might have quelled it but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and thus more turmoil in markets the residue that mattered most though was the reaction caused by dred scott instead of promoting unity and opening up the west to more settlement as buchanan had thought dred scott thwarted it and brought an end to years of northern prosperity yet the south did not succumb as badly its agrarian culture was self sustaining and its cotton still had market in europe there was surge in arms sales there as well the economic downturn in the north exacerbating regional tensions the relative good times in the south caused northerners of all parties to further blame buchanan for being southern lackey buchanan response was underwhelming almost disdainful he said the federal government could do nothing in his annual message in december he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the panic but he would do nothing for individual suffering the government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started but would begin no new ones he said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and deserved the gambler fate eventually he noted the youth and energy of the rugged american individuals would triumph though there would clearly be an interim of rough times in sense he was right because it took the rugged young americans who went to war in to bring the economy back throughout his term when fork appeared in the road buchanan managed to take the wrong turn when hostilities flared in kansas over whether that territory would enter as slave or free state buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid exacerbating the killings some done by the wild eyed anti slavery radical john brown when later brown seized arms with small cadre of followers in harpers ferry west virginia just miles from washington along the potomac buchanan again diddled before consulting robert lee who had fortuitously been home in arlington on leave from his post in texas lee quickly went to harpers ferry to capture brown and quell the raid in other ventures though buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions he caused chaos in utah quelling what he thought to be mormon revolt causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely jurisdictional dispute he supported mercenary william walker forays to conquer nicaragua and guatemala and sent troops to try to annex parts of paraguay primarily to acquiesce to his southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union then there was the little known pig war started when settler along the canadian border on the san juan straits in the northwest shot pig owned by the hudson bay co that wandered onto his property standoff ensued until buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding kansas where there was real problem out to calm the nonfatal except to one pig battle this was at time when there were about only soldiers in the army stretched as thin as could be as the election of came close buchanan refused to support the one democrat who could win stephen douglas because he just plain didn like him that caused the party to split into three factions each nominating candidate virtually ensuring republican abraham lincoln the election the southern states which had threatened secession started doing so during the interim between lincoln election and his inauguration in march thus under buchanan watch buchanan took the unusual position that the constitution did not allow secession but the president could not do anything to prevent it as the first half dozen states seceded buchanan lost several cabinet members he had lot of southern allies and refused entreaties by many including former president john tyler who would himself become confederate congressman to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold meanwhile buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the south fort sumter enter lincoln who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms speeches as the greatest of presidents lincoln no doubt was man with plans and savvy but contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no james buchanan the worst president ever there would have been few notches more on the presidential rating scale for abe lincoln to climb today george bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history thanks to his authorship of the iraq war and his presiding over the crash of and the beginning of the great recession obama is sometimes seen in the same light especially by the far right but as happened with honest abe and his predecessor perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for president hillary clinton or president donald trump to shine robert strauss is author of the forthcoming worst president ever james buchanan the potus rating game and the legacy of the least of the lesser presidents
worst president ever
nate smith executive director of the texas nationalist movement looked uncertain as man identifying himself as an east ukrainian resistance fighter pledged solidarity to smith struggle for an independent texas standing in conference room in the ritz hotel in central moscow on sunday smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card it wasn the only incongruous encounter taking place at the ritz at what has been dubbed moscow international conference of separatists an eclectic kremlin funded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for self rule for often unlikely territories amidst the heavy glitz of the hotel catalonian separatists and dissident irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east ukrainian rebels azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the self proclaimed king of hawaii who called in via video link and among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve self determination were two americans campaigning for texan and californian secession from the united states the conference now in its second year is funded largely by the kremlin and organized by the anti globalization movement of russia group that closely follows government positions the movement says it is unconnected to the kremlin but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by charitable fund founded by president vladimir putin which provided close to for the project according to public records the attendees including the texan delegate had been offered free flights and accommodation the conference organizers present it as platform for marginalized groups but its agenda overlaps with kremlin efforts to promote russia as an alternative guardian for global order at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged american imperialism our main goal is to create multi polar world the conference creator aleksander ionov told its participants our president vladimir vladimirovich putin is probably the main anti globalist in the world ionov himself relatively little known businessman has repeatedly met syrian president bashar al assad whom russia is backing militarily saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago ionov conference plays into moscow own long time policy of backing separatists in its former soviet neighbors while jailing and harassing separatist groups at home moscow has leveraged them abroad pretext for military intervention most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern ukraine sizable presence of pro russian rebel supporters was visible on sunday while not single russian separatist group took part all that and the anti american flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in the kremlin orbit it kind of awkward guess smith said after one minute denunciation of american inequity abc news smith group the texas nationalist movement is campaigning for referendum on whether texas should exit the united states founded over years ago the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the texas state gop to bring debate on secession referendum to the floor of the republican convention smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the kremlin we re here to have dialogue we re not in agreement with all the groups that are here smith said we re here for very specific reasons we came here to make statement on behalf of the people of texas it was sentiment echoed by louis marinelli from the yes california independence campaign there to get his message out about his plan to make the golden state nation we want to draw attention to our campaign marinelli said we re not signing an alliance with russia or anything like that the two secessionists urge for independence stems largely from distaste with american foreign policy and sense the has become dysfunctional gentle mannered it consultant married to russian marinelli is aiming for secession referendum by the government is so dysfunctional it can be repaired from within anymore and if we were separate nation running our own affairs we could improve the quality of life for californians marinelli said both men were hoping for donald trump victory in the presidential elections banking on surge in people looking to detach themselves from america the recent brexit vote to leave the european union had also heartened many attendees but why exactly the kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in moscow few among the foreign attendees could say nor did they appear particularly interested not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference smith said however the conference and its location in one of moscow expensive hotels within shouting distance of the kremlin walls slots into recognizable recent russian strategy russia has been backing far right political parties in the west in particular reportedly funding france anti european union party the front national with million loan the practice echoes that of the soviet union which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets it school book case said peter kreko fulbright visiting professor at indiana university who has studied russia use of the far right the simple reason is that russia is interested in dividing the western world the strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there kreko said the idea was to back groups hindering european integration and to undermine faith in western style liberal democracy the tool kit is pretty much the same as in the soviet union any kind of movements that can cause chaos kreko said adding he thought the conference was also prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint russia as champion of democracy few of the conference attendees were concerned they might become kremlin pawns seeing it simply as way to get their message out everybody using everybody marinelli said we re using this conference for our own purposes we want the attention so that we can get the word out they want he trailed off before finishing everybody got their own agenda right so that just the way it is for most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media attracted by the conference oddity ve talked to seven media organizations today ve got to get my story out said diarmuid mac dubhglais international secretary for republican sinn in tiny irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of british control over northern ireland in any case mac dubhglais said he wouldn let vladimir himself impose ideas on him not going to start passing out propaganda when go home and start marching soviet style he said besides he said perhaps the russian motive was altruistic maybe in fairness they might think the cause is just he said then paused before adding hoping that what they think

president barack obama has never had great relationship with saudi arabia now he the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities story continued below obama has cast the saudis as so called allies bemoaned the terrorist inspiring version of islam they practice and even suggested the oil rich arab state learn to share the middle east with rival iran the saudis meanwhile consider obama naive sparring with him over the iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands off approach to syria bloody civil war despite these differences obama has promised to veto bill that congress passed unanimously allowing families of victims to sue saudi arabia over alleged links to the terrorist attacks that obama and riyadh find themselves on the same side against congress underscores the bizarre evolution of saudi ties over the past eight years an alliance once unquestioned in washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism but the two countries still need each other enough that breakup is simply not in the cards this is clearly relationship in transition said jon alterman an analyst with the center for strategic and international studies nobody really has sense of what they re trying to transition it to just how tricky is the relationship two more examples obama is supporting the saudis in their fight against iran backed rebels in yemen even though officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the islamic state and many of the same lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the saudis just this week green lit billion arms sale to the country does no one sense the irony asked republican sen rand paul of kentucky one of handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the senate the back and forth in washington is schizophrenic behavior that has deeply frustrated leaders in the middle east for years said former senior official deeply familiar with the arab world congress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the th anniversary of the sept attacks the saudis through direct contacts as well as powerful set of lobbyists have tried hard to stop it waging major pr effort that included releasing white paper detailing the kingdom efforts to stop terrorists the saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the has never found proof of it either the saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in assets to protect themselves against lawsuits administration officials downplay the idea that obama will veto the bill merely to protect saudi arabia normally citizens aren allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity obama concern officials say thus goes well beyond the saudis he worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the to be sued over its actions abroad to pass piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even american businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish white house spokesman josh earnest said in recent press briefing the perception in many quarters however is that obama is coming to the aid of country with much to hide fifteen of the hijackers on sept were saudi nationals and the recent of roughly pages from congressional probe into the attacks raised more questions about saudi government ties to islamist extremists we are disappointed that the president is not standing with us said mindy kleinberg who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers thursday to push for veto override we have been waiting very long time for justice and we feel that this bill will go long way toward accountability whatever his motivation obama decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease saudi suspicions the saudis wariness of obama has its roots in his comments in well before he ran for president referring to the monarchy in riyadh as so called ally it grew after obama sided against egyptian strongman hosni mubarak during the arab spring movements leading saudi royals to question whether america would have their backs in domestic political crisis of their own it deepened in after obama decided not to stage military strike against syrian president bashar assad who is despised by the saudis even after assad apparently crossed obama red line by using chemical weapons and it reached new peak in after obama struck nuclear deal with iran shiite theocracy that sunni majority saudi arabia views as growing threat in the middle east still obama cognizant of the need for the to maintain alliances with stable countries in the middle east has otherwise tried hard to allay saudi concerns he cut short trip to india to rush to see the newly crowned saudi king salman in january after the previous monarch died he also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the saudis in part to assuage saudi concerns about the iran nuclear deal but earlier this year in comments to the atlantic magazine that infuriated the saudis obama appeared to reverse decades of policy that tilted heavily toward riyadh and against tehran the competition between the saudis and the iranians which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in syria and iraq and yemen requires us to say to our friends as well as to the iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace obama said prince turki al faisal the former head of saudi intelligence wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that obama had thrown us curve ball and criticizing the president for saying america gulf allies were free riders wholly dependent on the for their security and in april weeks after the atlantic piece was published saudi arabia appeared to snub obama when he visited riyadh for summit by sending lower level official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state tv the readouts from those meetings in riyadh also suggested the president hadn done much to assuage saudi concerns with the two sides saying they discussed and exchanged views more than agreeing on anything the president also hosted saudi arabia deputy crown prince mohammed bin salman when he visited washington this summer on trip aimed at improving the kingdom image in washington obama made sure to praise the prince plan to transform the saudi economy dubbed vision he also tried to reassure the saudi royal that the will back the saudis against interference by iran which remains an official enemy of the united states but some constants in the saudi relationship have turned into variables meaning that even after obama leaves office in just few months the alliance could prove rocky the low price of oil for example is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy the also relies more now on its own energy reserves reducing america addiction to saudi oil some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative saudi arabia women though still facing severe segregation make up growing share of the workforce young people are more exposed than ever to the internet and the outside world and thousands of saudis educated in the are now capitalizing on that experience in their country by all accounts the and saudi arabia still maintain strong security relationship and officials privately say the saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as al qaeda which the saudi monarchy views as threat to its own rule officials also say the saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant the close cooperation on countering violent extremists like the islamic state the continued saudi preference for american arms the important role that saudi arabia plays in international energy markets and the billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future said fahad nazer former political analyst with the saudi embassy in washington who now does similar work for jtg inc in many ways what obama thinks about the saudis matters less and less as his time in the oval office draws to an end but while the saudis will be happy to see him leave there great uncertainty in riyadh about how the next president will deal with them both democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump have voiced grave concerns about saudi arabia track record of producing islamic extremists clinton has said she supports the lawsuit bill but while clinton would likely be more predictable partner the saudis see trump who has called for ban on muslims entering the united states as wild card for now however the saudis are nervously watching congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them already some members of congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the legislation after all and that they may consider voting to uphold obama veto their hesitation comes as growing number of foreign countries and blocs including the european union voice opposition to the bill the original bill passed on voice vote in both houses making veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record and with the presidential election looming the politics are even more fraught than normal saudi arabia has never been an especially popular actor in washington powerful one but not popular the former senior official said and now nobody in congress wants to stick their neck out for the saudis two and half months before the presidential election authors

would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter sen mitch mcconnell said getty mcconnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal senate majority leader mitch mcconnell delayed procedural vote on must pass government spending measure monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over handful of provisions in the bill even with months long impasse over zika funding largely resolved the key vote is now scheduled for tuesday mcconnell said giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until dec for now however sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the zika virus while allowing planned parenthood partner clinic in puerto rico to access the federal grants provision that had been major point of contention story continued below senate republicans stand ready to move forward mcconnell ky said monday would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter mcconnell spent about five minutes huddling with senate minority leader harry reid nev on monday afternoon as they sought to strike deal that would allow the senate to recess as soon as the end of the week but the tentative resolution on zika funding sets aside for now one of the toughest sticking points in the short term spending measure senate democrats had repeatedly filibustered standalone zika bill over restrictions that barred planned parenthood particularly profamilias the health care provider partner in puerto rico from the federal funds but in the cr the puerto rico clinic would have access to the money which would come through million social services block grant in broader billion zika package multiple sources said language in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding skirting political landmine that delayed zika aid for months despite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito borne disease several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations in brief interview monday morning reid said no when asked whether there would be deal on government funding later in the day close is relative reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach for instance funding for the water crisis in flint michigan continues to be in the mix democrats on both ends of the capitol have lobbied for flint funds to be included in the government spending package in particular the aid package included in senate water resources bill but republicans have similar demands additional funding for flood stricken louisiana in the short term spending measure both issues remained unresolved as of monday evening although senior senate democrats suggested they wouldn accept flood aid without also getting money for flint congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the zika funding package louisiana is not resolved because republicans want to do louisiana we want to do flint sen chuck schumer told reporters monday evening they don want to do flint another issue that remains up in the air is potential delay in the obama administration proposal to hand over the government authority over the internet domain system to an international body on oct push that being led by texas sen ted cruz and host of other republican lawmakers if no deference is paid to cruz and those lawmakers the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among republicans even with some pushback on the provision from democrats this is the coordination of the domain names it not who has control of the internet florida sen bill nelson the top democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue said monday and every institution nationally and internationally have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do meanwhile democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the export import bank to finance projects greater than million which it hasn been able to do because three of the five seats on the bank board are vacant the ex im issue is similarly toxic among republicans making it difficult matter to take up ahead of an election there are other items that could fill up the senate legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the november elections sens chris murphy conn and rand paul ky plan to force senate vote to block billion arms sale to saudi arabia that the obama administration announced last month senate majority whip john cornyn texas said the exact timing of that vote was unclear particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with roll call to formally override an expected veto by president barack obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the sept terrorism attacks to sue the government of saudi arabia though obama has not yet vetoed the measure he has until friday to do so republicans who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection particularly with control of the senate in the balance privately believe democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the sept deadline to pass government funding heather caygle contributed to this report authors

in the first half of the debate donald trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles after peddling for weeks lucrative conspiracy that hillary clinton is too sick to be commander in chief one must ask themselves why trump couldn stop sniffling is he sick was he holding back tears after being pummeled by clinton howard dean former head of the dnc and presidential candidate has more unconventional answer he was on drugs dean who is now contributor for msnbc tweeted last night notice trump sniffing all the time coke user howard dean govhowarddean september trump supporters took to twitter to express outrage completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against clinton and her stamina abilities but hey get offended when dean points out what could be the obvious after all trump did protect cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system and considering he hasn released any medical records who knows what adverse effects drugs if he does them has done to his body and mental state of course trump denied he was sniffling even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country and the globe and the republican nominee denies that he is sick so that begs the question what else could it be dean assertion is just that an assertion it has no factual ground to stand on but it is ironic to see how trump supporters react when conspiracy is made against their candidate perhaps they and trump will think long and hard before trying to paint clinton as anything she not if this debate showed one thing it that hillary came out on top and trump is not happy about it why not have little fun at his petulant behavior howard dean is featured image via joe readle getty images

on monday donald trump fulfilled his duty as presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching ahmad khan rahami who was responsible for the saturday bombing in new york city this would have normally been nice gesture if it hadn been contradiction of something trump had said just few minutes before fortunately whenever trump flip flops or lies americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh via social media and they didn hesitate to remind trump that just few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for rahami capture he dissed the nypd for allowing political correctness to interfere with catching terrorists among the first to point this out was msnbc christopher hayes who tweeted hayes was referring to disrespectful comment trump had made on fox and friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers in which he said you know our police are amazing our local police they know who lot of these people are they are afraid to do anything about it because they don want to be accused of profiling and they don want to be accused of all sorts of things yup trump had accused the nypd of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame other people recognized this epic fail as well and blasted the republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two faced this tweet was particularly funny and sure there will be some backlash for trump to deal with throughout his presidential campaign trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than african american police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is law and order candidate but thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists trump has probably just ruined year of pro law enforcement campaigning featured image via spencer platt getty images

ap photo mcconnell pelosi ryan seek deal on government funding impasse total of million for the flint water crisis is added to the wrda bill speaker paul ryan senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house minority leader nancy pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the sept budget deadline fast approaches in series of three way discussions on tuesday night the trio of party leaders were forging compromise to extend government funding until dec in turn republicans would provide an iron clad commitment that funding to address the water crisis in flint michigan will be included in the water resources development act which covers hundreds of federal water projects story continued below late tuesday congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi layered discussions pelosi and ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about million in federal aid for flint the amendment represents bipartisan agreement between speaker ryan and leader pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to wrda as an amendment that will at the end of the day provide the necessary funding flint needs in the final wrda conference report pelosi aide said late tuesday night the water resources legislation could head to the house floor as early as wednesday pelosi and other democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution or cr to keep the government open without the flint funding ryan for his part faced problems rounding up gop votes for short term funding bill with ryan and pelosi holding direct talks deal was expected soon to break the impasse mcconnell and pelosi had also held discussions on the flint wrda issue said gop and democratic sources mcconnell had been pushing to include flint funding in the wrda package meanwhile senate minority leader harry reid nev had been making his own insistence for flint aid clear with republicans earlier senate republicans had been considering stripping louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill which in theory could have resolved senate democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off government shutdown at the end of the week that proposal had come after democrats voted tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure which would keep the government open until dec because the package provides money for louisiana and other states but did nothing to address flint mcconnell had been expected to unveil revised legislative text with no louisiana disaster relief one senior gop leadership aide said but any formal action will now wait until wednesday the kentucky republican floated the idea at news conference tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed far short of the vote threshold we keep hearing that their position is no flint no floods mcconnell said that certainly an option worth discussing informed of that comment reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what mcconnell would do and again said democrats wanted relief for both louisiana and flint but other democrats suggested the move would pave the way to resolution if louisiana were not in there it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill and that would be helpful said senate minority whip richard durbin there still really deep felt feelings by our michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in flint and we don trust the house to help at all durbin added house minority whip steny hoyer also said democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities but that they would likely back so called continuing resolution that included aid for neither doubt that we would turn that down he told reporters hoyer said democrats would insist the legislation still contain billion to combat the zika virus which has long been stalled on capitol hill the measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement july law to curb prescription opioid addiction senate republicans had argued that the proper place for flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through congress the senate passed the water resources development act which includes million for flint and other communities with failing infrastructure on vote earlier this month why do you feel as if you have to punish people in louisiana who are digging out from flood sounds kind of crazy but they have mud in their home they have to dig out for flint when there pathway forward on flint through the wrda bill argued gop sen bill cassidy who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of louisiana still despite vows from some senate republicans that flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the house and senate in lame duck session democrats had been skeptical meanwhile democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues prohibition on the securities and exchange commission ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending but that provision has been secondary issue to the fight over flint mcconnell and reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of shutdown but few think such politically damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election if the senate is able to pass funding bill the house would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly among the votes in favor of the bill were four democrats including those representing conservative leaning states like jon tester of montana joe manchin of west virginia and joe donnelly of indiana as well as bill nelson of florida where the zika virus is spreading quickly thirteen republicans joined most democrats in voting against the bill including conservatives ted cruz of texas and mike lee of utah and south carolina lindsey graham cruz led failed fight to include language blocking the obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the internet domain system to an international body graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the export import bank heather caygle rachael bade and annie snider contributed to this story authors

to address the charlotte unrest trump also presented himself as the man to heal america racial divide story continued below before going any further today want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country and it seems to be never ending problem trump said america desperately needs unity and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times and we ve had some tough times but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as nation he called for swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement insisting that such actions hurt law abiding african american families most and proposed national anti crime agenda to address what he characterized as national crisis he also vowed to make american cities safer by appointing the best prosecutors investigators and federal law enforcement officers and sympathized with police officers who carry an immense responsibility but must be trained properly respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing and he took shot at obama leadership or lack thereof we all have to walk mile in someone else shoes see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country mean it we have some real problems and we do have wounded country trump said many americans are watching the unrest in charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the tv screens others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand our country looks bad to the world especially when we are supposed to be the world leader how can we lead when we can even control our own cities trump who emphasized that it will be the th president responsibility to address this crisis and save african american lives has made an attempt to gain support from african americans in recent weeks albeit through narrative of poorly educated impoverished black people who live in crime ridden inner cities and who after years of democratic policies he says has failed them have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign trump overtures to black voters often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences have done little to dent hillary clinton point advantage among african americans and his sometimes ham fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage only hours earlier he recommended controversial stop and frisk policy policing tactic that has been found to targets minorities to curb violence in chicago obama hometown and made the unsubstantiated claim that drugs are very very big factor in what happening in charlotte still trump has tried to cast himself as unifying figure earlier thursday during phone interview with fox and friends the republican presidential nominee said there just seems that there lack of spirit between the white and the black mean it terrible thing that we re witnessing he continued you re seeing it seeing it and you look at what went on last night in charlotte great place and you just see it protests over the killing of keith lamont scott black man who was fatally shot by police on tuesday turned violent on wednesday night leading north carolina gov pat mccrory to declare state of emergency in charlotte by thursday charlotte officials and scott family were arguing over whether he had been carrying gun when he was shot charlotte mecklenburg police chief kerr putney told reporters that police believe scott was armed though he acknowledged that video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively putney said the video would be shown to scott family but did not commit to releasing it to the public at press conference thursday afternoon attorneys for scott family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it charles monnett one of the family lawyers said the family decision would depend on whether the video can somehow help us reach that truth justin bamberg another of the family attorney said he had not seen any evidence that gun was present at the scene where scott was shot bamberg dismissed photos showing gun at the scene by remarking that pictures pop up online all the time they come from different sources he said that as far as he was aware scott did not own gun bamberg also confirmed that scott wife was present when he was shot at the end of the day my priority is the greater good of this family first that has to be understood bamberg said when asked why the family legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public yes we want transparency we don create the facts we live with the facts but you can take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on deceased person for their family who is in mourning the obama administration meanwhile urged calm but the president himself had not made statement as of et on thursday attorney general loretta lynch addressed the difficulties her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions know that these are difficult times and know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers she said but also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days let us seek all peaceful way forward white house press secretary josh earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully unfortunately we ve seen situations in which small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and in some cases violence he said we ve often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported wednesday violence erupted as residents outraged over scott death and that of an unarmed black man in tulsa oklahoma last week looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown charlotte according to reports police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters several of whom were injured including one who was shot by another protester police said see it even going out there such lack of there lack of spirit trump said there lack of something something going on that bad and what going on between police and others is getting worse the real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order pitching it as the solution to the unrest in charlotte and outrage nationwide over police involved shootings of black men who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot well it wow here we go again trump said it very sad when you look at what going on it very sad it very divided our country and it getting worse not overly surprised to see it but it happening trump argued that dialogue between police and the communities they serve won solve this problem pointing to the ambush in dallas this summer when black man killed five officers and injured dozen more if you look at dallas there was dialogue they prided themselves on dialogue trump said and they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and you know that was that was pretty rough situation to put it mildly terrible terrible situation that sounds good it sounds right but there something deeper than that what necessary trump maintained is combination of law and order and leadership that can unify divided nation leadership he intimated is lacking from america current leader well it really has to be you have to have law and order at the time you have to have you know you have to have certain spirit certain unity and there no unity trump said you look at the level of hatred the you know the rocks being thrown and everything happening it so sad to see you know this is the united states of america mean it so sad to see but there just no unity there has to be unity message that has to get out and it starts with leadership but what trump didn say explicitly his surrogates did former house speaker newt gingrich and former new york mayor rudy giuliani appeared in separate fox news segments in which they both slammed obama lack of leadership first of all it tragedy that eight years after our first african american president took office eight years after we ve had two african american attorney generals the gap and the hostility if anything is worse and think that tragic failure of leadership gingrich said but my guess is he was afraid it make him black president in narrowing sense he added he could have launched program to try to rebuild and reopen and re engineer hope in these communities and instead he became the person who talked about you know the cambridge policeman was wrong and you know ferguson was wrong and why florida was wrong giuliani said obama should have lectured americans on constitutional law wednesday referring to last friday shooting death of terence crutcher who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by white police officer the former new york mayor acknowledged that that incident was more difficult situation than what transpired in charlotte that belongs in the ambiguous troubling category but even there you gotta say to people wait let the investigation play out the president of the united states should have said that yesterday giuliani said the president of the united states should have given people teeny bit of lecture on constitutional law that we presume people innocent and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else authors

on wednesday the senate is expected to override president obama veto for the first time on bill that would allow the families of victims to sue saudi arabia so how exactly does veto override work the rules are described in article section of the constitution when the president rejects bill he is required to return it along with his objections to the chamber in which the bill originated then the members of that chamber shall enter the objections at large on their journal and proceed to reconsider it in other words the president sends vetoed senate bills back to the senate to reconsider first and vetoed house bills back to the house to reconsider first in this case the justice against sponsors of terrorism act or jasta began in the senate so the senate votes first both the house and the senate require two thirds majority to successfully override president veto both chambers also require the yeas and nays to be counted in the house the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the senate they take roll call vote in which each senator name is called by the clerk though the senate received president obama veto message on friday they re not voting on it until wednesday this is common according to the congressional research service because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill including the amount of debate time on the senate floor then when the vetoed bill comes up for vote the presiding officer of that chamber states shall the bill pass the objections of the president of the united states to the contrary notwithstanding while some senate democrats and republicans have concerns that the jasta bill would open the united states up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with saudi arabia key middle east ally the veto override is expected to easily garner the two thirds votes needed to pass assuming it clears the senate the jasta veto override will then head to the house where the same voting process will ensue if the veto override is successful in the house and the senate the bill will become law because two thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president objection

sen mitch mcconnell said filed spending measure is the result of many many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle getty mcconnell plays hardball in spending fight mitch mcconnell is playing hardball forcing democrats into take it or leave it position on must pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month with spending negotiations still stymied at the capitol mcconnell filed new short term government spending measure thursday that concedes key priorities to democrats yet still isn enough to get the minority party on board story continued below gone is the so called icann provision an internet domain issue that had become top priority for sen ted cruz texas and other gop senators and just got the seal of endorsement from gop nominee donald trump it also includes some funding for sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year as well as landmark chemical safety measure that became law in june the new spending measure mcconnell filed thursday which funds the government until dec also includes language already worked out between democrats and republicans to deal with additional funding for the zika virus epidemic procedural vote on the measure is slated for tuesday afternoon and mcconnell used parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option there have been broad requests for clean continuing resolution so that what ve just offered mcconnell said it the result of many many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle but democrats who have little incentive to agree quickly to deal that lets vulnerable republicans leave washington say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as louisiana west virginia and maryland it doesn include money for the long running water crisis in flint michigan to put louisiana in without flint is like waving red flag don get it said new york sen chuck schumer the third ranking senate democrat haven counted votes but our caucus isn going to like having louisiana and not michigan it also does not remove language that prohibits the securities and exchange commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending that is current law but democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations democrats also floated provision related to the export import bank that would have restored the bank full financing authority but that was not included in the spending measure mcconnell filed thursday that ex im provision was also important for some republicans south carolina sen lindsey graham said he would vote against the short term funding bill because that language was excluded the president does not believe that short term budget measure that only exists because congress hasn done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law white house press secretary josh earnest said thursday while slamming republicans for their opposition to the ex im bank yet mcconnell proposal is also starting to drive rift through democrats while some leading senate democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure other democrats began to side with republicans democratic sen bill nelson whose home state of florida has been the nation epicenter of the zika crisis said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside billion to combat zika with no political riders while support the people of flint my priority is the people of florida nelson said senate minority leader harry reid nev signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before mcconnell went to the floor to unveil it thursday afternoon we re in no hurry to go anyplace ok we have all

donald trump campaign isn alone in patronizing his own businesses taxpayers are indirectly doing so too federal election commission records show that the secret service has paid the trump campaign about million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on plane owned and operated by one of his companies story continued below it standard practice for the agency which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates in fact the secret service has reimbursed the clinton campaign too million so far this cycle the difference with trump is that one of his companies tag air inc owns the plane so the government is effectively paying him the clinton campaign by contrast mostly has been chartering planes from private company called executive fliteways in which the clintons do not have any ownership interest the taxpayers are actually reimbursing trump for the travel of the secret service agents said brett kappel campaign finance lawyer at the law firm akerman llp it just another example of how the trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at trump owned facilities trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks responded to questions about the secret service payments by saying everything was done in accordance with fec guidelines and regulations please direct further questions to usss secret service spokeswoman nicole mainor said the fec specifically requires security personnel such as the secret service to reimburse campaigns for seats on charter aircraft politico analysis of fec records found that through the end of august trump campaign has spent at least million at trump own businesses including to hold events at his hotels buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his manhattan office tower but the biggest chunk of the expenses almost million were to tag air inc trump who once said could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree he has made point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets the campaign in statement on thursday rejected that criticism as misleading and flat out wrong pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at trump businesses is far less than the million of his own money that trump has pumped into the campaign the statement explained the campaign payments to tag air and other trump owned companies by saying the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space air travel and accommodations and has fulfilled all fec requirements throughout the campaign the government practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their secret service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower budget affairs the logic being candidates shouldn have to use their own resources on required security according to craig engle political lawyer at arent fox who helped draft the provision as staffer at the federal election commission it basically just calling it even engle said it either trump making contribution to the government or the government reimburses the trump campaign for its expenses the same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates the journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs so it conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the trump campaign for the cost of staying in trump owned hotel or flying on trump owned plane the secret service could also end up paying trump hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there but those expenses don appear in fec reports because the government pays them directly the agency paid the trump campaign an additional for air travel that was refunded according to the fec reports which do not offer an explanation for the refund of course trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail in august trump campaign spent on security related costs including payments to private companies such as xmark llc black tie protection services and ks global group as well as local police in places he visited authors

sen chuck schumer money could give democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in florida and ohio getty schumer transfers millions to dems in bid for senate takeover chuck schumer is sitting on mountain of cash and now he starting to dole it out to fellow democrats who might make him majority leader the new york senator is transferring million to the senate democrats campaign arm on tuesday he also given million to state parties over the past week democratic sources said story continued below earlier this month schumer shifted an additional million from his campaign war chest to the democratic senatorial campaign committee altogether in september schumer has transferred million of the million he has on hand to help democratic hopefuls republicans control seats but democrats are favored to win three back so control of the chamber is seen as toss up as the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut significant transfer from schumer could go long way the kochs do not have finite amount of money they have unlimited money we have finite amount of money said senate minority leader harry reid nev in an interview on monday we re just trying to allocate our resources so they re meaningful to us and our candidates schumer money could give democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in florida and ohio and eye instead cheaper races in north carolina and missouri no one has more to gain from democratic takeover of the senate than schumer who will ascend to the leader job in as reid retires after year stint as party head schumer donation is both vote of confidence in his party candidates and reflection of democrats future challenges democrats are defending seats in compared with just eight gop seats so if democrats come up short in november they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade schumer has also raised million directly for candidates committees and joint account that he leads has collected combined for the dscc and individual candidates he planning fall event in new york to benefit senate candidates that projected to bring in upwards of another million according to person close to the new york senator schumer has been relentless said dscc official schumer and reid have also appeared at numerous events for senate majority pac super pac backing democratic senate hopefuls run by former aides to reid including his onetime chief of staff susan mccue the group which can accept unlimited donations from donors has spent more than million this cycle democrats complain that republican super pacs have far outspent them leader reid and senator schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money republicans are pouring into senate races through independent expenditures the amounts are staggering mccue said in statement schumer still will have roughly million on hand after the transfer he is up for reelection in new york with the latest polls showing him trouncing his gop challenger by more than points however if past is prologue schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition schumer spent about million in but that was historically bad year for democrats schumer colleagues won rule out the possibility that he ll donate more to his party senate takeover effort if he thinks it will make difference he ll do it he very calculating said democratic senator chuck will be there if you need him sen debbie stabenow mich close ally of schumer agreed that the presumptive democratic leader might provide more he going to watch everything closely it my sense he percent committed to taking back the senate stabenow said there no decision yet on where the dscc might allocate the additional money from schumer it could go toward races in new hampshire pennsylvania or nevada states that are all exceedingly close or help compete in pricey florida using the cash in red leaning states is another option we re going to make some tough decisions which haven been made yet reid said the national republican senatorial committee has been outraised by the dscc to the tune of million outside groups like the senate leadership fund are making up the difference but republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers with mcconnell coming up with nearly million in transfers thus far sen john thune made big splash with million transfer but even though he has millions more on hand thune said he ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash don think can probably keep pace with schumer thune said in an interview republicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members after sen richard shelby of alabama spurned transferring any of his million now the gop hopes that nrsc vice chairs dean heller of nevada and tom cotton of arkansas may make last minute transfer they have yet to give money directly to the group gop sources said though they have helped raise funds directly for the nrsc the third vice chair joni ernst of iowa gave last week an aide said tuesday morning republicans however simply don have their own chuck schumer instead they are relying on tightening presidential race deep pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of trump to eke out win he machine senate majority whip john cornyn of texas said of schumer his workout partner but it may not make difference the texan added authors

shares share this story the first debate showdown of republican nominee donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton was expected to be brutal altercation between the two candidates instead the viewing audience was treated to one sided destruction with clinton appearing cool and presidential while trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support and clinton invited billionaire mark cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against trump in the media there is no love lost between the two businessmen and cuban even said of trump there was no bigger jagoff in the world the indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of cuban to being in debt at least million the shameless trump who became more unhinged as the night progressed freely gave away one of his biggest secrets that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years clinton speculated about this and like predictable rube under the hot lights trump cracked under the pressure rather than offer an explanation or deflection to clinton hypothesis trump agreed he paid no taxes and said that makes me smart trump cheap explanation sounded like something third grader on the playground would offer rather than presidential candidate an hour after the debate trump immediately began walking back his statement and denied he had ever said it this type of shamelessness is difficult to combat when asked it sounds like you admitted you haven paid federal taxes and that was smart is that what you meant to say trump replied no didn say that at all trump insulted every american who pays their fair share of taxes and cuban was not amused nor impressed after the debate cuban said get audited every year my taxes are it takes me minutes just to sign all the different taxes that have to spend and tell my tax lawyers and everybody you know take advantage of do what the law recommends but not against paying taxes and ll give you perfect example when the dallas mavericks were building new practice facility which was just opening had the opportunity to go to dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything didn do it couple years ago we had some issues in dallas just wrote check to the general treasury this year we had after the shootings in orlando had concerns about the lgbt community in dallas just wrote million dollar check to the city of dallas to support bunch of different programs the luckiest guy in the world there nobody who been as blessed as me and my family so far knock on wood is healthy and at some point you have to realize you have to give back and you have to realize that this is country that been great to us and you can just take take take take take take mcuban on trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart debatenight pic twitter com upnunatukv stefan becket becket september the contrast between cuban and trump could not be more stark cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him while admitting he owes his success to society trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible while offering to pay back nothing did trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes no did trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes no trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent because if they did they would certainly not support him trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made chinese goods to which his name is affixed in trump world there is two tiered system one for him and one for everyone else add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president crimes impeach donald trump

new york all politics is geopolitical in this year presidential race and top democrats and republicans fear that will reshape america relationships around the world no matter who wins this week the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in new york as the united nations general assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim story continued below on monday hillary clinton will meet with ukrainian president petro poroshenko clear dig at the developing partnership between vladimir putin and donald trump she ll also sit with japanese prime minister shinzo abe her campaign announced sunday night rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of china and north korea while reminding americans of donald trump suggestion that america should pull its support from japan and south korea clinton and trump both have scheduled meetings with egyptian president abdel fattah el sisi an american ally though one with dictatorial tendencies the democratic nominee set hers up first aiming to project to voters that she up to speed on counter terrorism and other issues roiling the region trump came second and was an attempt by sisi to ensure even dealings according to egypt state news agency nonetheless it might offer the republican nominee chance to frame up position on middle east issues that goes beyond simply banning muslim immigrants from america keeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for mitt romney four years ago and obama summer foreign tour was built around person rally in berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward looking europeans and support the upstart young senator but none of this compares to the degree to which this year race is defined by global affairs the result of the first former secretary of state in years to be nominated for president and the challenges trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of american foreign policy clinton is already planning if elected to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that trump and the number of votes he gets in november isn sign that they need to be worried about america turning away from them she very concerned said clinton aide there no doubt that when you have major presidential candidacy saying what he said it has an effect on foreign policy certainly presidential politics simply no longer stops at the water edge and this year it has lapped aggressively perhaps dangerously over america borders it will have lasting impact said sen ben cardin md the ranking member on the foreign relations committee it has been changed agreed rep peter king former chairman of the homeland security committee and trump supporter it gets little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it there has been long list of international never befores in including trump decision to accept an invitation from mexico president and then commandeer joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare america sovereign right to build wall separating the two countries and that hardly all there was the alleged russian led hacking of democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through wikileaks trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of crimea from the gop party platform italian prime minister matteo renzi saying he personally rooting for clinton vice president joe biden saying trump doesn understand nato on trip to latvia last month president barack obama getting asked by foreign leaders for year to weigh in on the presidential election and just friday london mayor sadiq khan speaking in chicago accused trump of playing into the hands of isil officials openly wonder what clinton approach as president would be now to mexican president enrique pe nieto or how quickly and forcefully nato would restructure if trump wins what if china or russia or north korea moves to test the new president right after inauguration day what if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts while many in washington diplomatic community say they have clearer sense of how clinton as opposed to trump would want to respond doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do her meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on trump the aide acknowledged but they re also about thinking through what being on the job on jan might entail take poroshenko who is rebuking putin just by being in office it impossible not to read politics into it somewhat but because of the way trump been talking over the course of the campaign secretary clinton thinks it important from policy standpoint the aide said if trump wins he ll have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that voters had elected him and afraid that he would ushering in new and dangerous world order they will certainly want to see where we re coming from king said he will have to clarify and make it clear where he coming from if clinton wins she ll have clean up that cardin and others compare to the repair mission obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on george bush cardin who firmly behind clinton ran through litany sitting in harare earlier in the year watching zimbabwean president robert mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to trump success the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter can you imagine if trump were president and we re trying to get coalition against isil and we need to get the support of moderate sunni states and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position can you imagine what donald trump comments about muslims coming to america would have on leader of moderate muslim state cardin said it that type of problems that have now been caused this has all made for tricky travels for obama as he spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified being abroad doesn stop people from asking for his take on trump and the race whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far it not mystery to people overseas that democrats and republicans in the united states have their differences said senior administration official so that why leaders traveling overseas don make as much of an effort to conceal it from the beginning of his presidency obama saw himself as embodying generational shift in the world order from shifting more of the burden in the middle east to arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on putin and brought the iranians to the nuclear negotiating table to reopening cuba he ll make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the general assembly tuesday morning but the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is trump didn run his mexico trip by the white house clinton didn run her meetings this week by the white house either we re having serious debate said ivo daalder now the president of the chicago council on global affairs and obama first permanent representative to nato we re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate authors

terrorism is terrorism regardless of the source and two american cities felt the sting of it over the weekend is it really that hard to say apparently and if someone on the left does summon up the word it must always be supplemented with descriptor one of two terrorist attacks bombing occurred this weekend in manhattan no one has come forward to admit to planting the device which exploded in dumpster cuomo said but citizens should make no mistake bomb exploding in new york is an act of terrorism got that at the time he stated sunday morning that no one or group had claimed responsibility yet he was quick to insist it was not the work of isis or any specific group however he also added that we re not going to let them win they want to make you afraid we re not going to let them instill fear okay so cuomo admitted he we don know who the bomber is yet he knows for fact it is definitely not isis but we can let them win if he we don know who the bomber is may ask who them is knowing that even in the face of tragedy democrats consider everything through political lens is the definitely not isis exclamation by governor cuomo veiled attempt not to tie obama mass immigration of muslims to the don know but wouldn doubt it the manhattan bomber may not be the work of an islamist but the attack at minnesota mall on saturday sure was as stated regardless of the source the two acts were terrorism none the less it is not hard to say terrorism unless you re nyc mayor bill de blasio who like many apologists on the left just couldn bring himself to utter the word when pressed he merely stated the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

shares share this story ninety six year old world war ii veteran and longtime new yorker contributor roger angell has voted in eighteen elections as he prepares to vote in his nineteenth he has published an op ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience and sends dire warning to the american people this man who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation including the prospect of nuclear armageddon believes that the election of republican nominee donald trump would be catastrophe on the same level my country faces danger unmatched in our history since the cuban missile crisis in or perhaps since when the axis powers held most of continental europe and imperial japan controlled the pacific rim from the aleutians to the solomon islands with the outcome of that war still unknown angell acknowledges trump long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart military service and the lessons of the second world war the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought stick at different moment the lighthearted comment he made when in early august an admiring veteran presented him with replica of his purple heart and mr trump said always wanted to get the purple heart this was much easier mr trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow he had chance but skimmed out like so many others of his time and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat this is the dream of nine year old boy and it impugns the five hundred thousand young americans who have died in combat in my lifetime and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war take this personally representing as do the last sliver of the sixteen million americans who served in the military in my war experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends classmates and companions of my youth who remain young and fresh in memory have named them in previous pieces along with some wounded survivors like my friend gardner an infantry captain who landed at normandy beach and fought at rtgen forest and aachen and the battle of the bulge was twice wounded my late brother in law neil who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of belfort gap and who hobbled with cane all his life and with two canes near the end every american of my generation can supply stories like these and once learned and tried to forget that worldwide seventy million people died in our war far too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict or never learned them at all as in trump case trump is selfish coward at his core draft dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young americans who perished in the jungles of vietnam man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once they ve served their purpose trump is uniquely ill suited for the presidency man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle negatives that deeply disturb mr angell mr trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down who cannot appear to pause or lose he is man who must win stay on the attack and who thinks first and last how will look this is central and what comes after it for me at times is concern for what it must be like for anyone who facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this finds only the narcissist mirror for reassurance on the other hand mr angell has glowing praise for democratic nominee hillary clinton woman who has spent her entire life in public service who has shown time and time again that she has backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the presidency will cast my own vote for hillary clinton with alacrity and confidence from the beginning her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged she is intelligent strong profoundly informed and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality her well established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis ms clinton will make strong and resolute president at last female leader of our own and in the end perhaps unifying one he saves his best criticism for the end however as he nervously ponders what president trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the white house if donald trump wins this election his nights in the white house will very soon resemble those of president obama new day is arriving and with it the latest rush of bad news another police shooting out west another suicide bomber in yemen and other urgent briefings from world already caught up in the morning difficult events he needs to respond but the beginning of this president response is always reliably at hand how will look we absolutely cannot elect president that will put his own public image above the needs of the american people read

louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at suspect who had his hands up in the air this is sadly becoming too common story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair trigger fingers grows what makes this story sadly and horrifically unique though is that deputy derrick stafford also shot and killed the suspect six year old son and stafford is claiming self defense for that because of course he is stafford out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by christopher few which would put the officers in imminent danger officers went after christopher few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside bar just before the shooting they claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down few whose six year old son jeremy was in the front passenger seat rounds were fired although few had his hands up but no firearm was found in the car and few and jeremy were both shot while still in the car stafford and his partner norris greenhouse said that after few drove forward and then backed up they were in fear for their lives so they fired that always the story though it makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later claiming they were in fear for their lives when it obvious that their suspects were unarmed and even had their hands in the air reports claim that neither stafford nor greenhouse knew jeremy was in the car when they opened fire few was critically wounded and jeremy who was autistic non verbal and in special needs first grade class was murdered stafford plea of self defense is huge middle finger to few and the rest of jeremy grieving family arguments will be heard in court next week where judge william bennett will decide whether the indictments stand featured image via louisiana state police facebook page

trump launches crooked hillary snapchat filter for debate
shares share this story the first debate showdown of republican nominee donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton was expected to be brutal altercation between the two candidates instead the viewing audience was treated to one sided destruction with clinton appearing cool and presidential while trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support and clinton invited billionaire mark cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against trump in the media there is no love lost between the two businessmen and cuban even said of trump there was no bigger jagoff in the world the indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of cuban to being in debt at least million the shameless trump who became more unhinged as the night progressed freely gave away one of his biggest secrets that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years clinton speculated about this and like predictable rube under the hot lights trump cracked under the pressure rather than offer an explanation or deflection to clinton hypothesis trump agreed he paid no taxes and said that makes me smart trump cheap explanation sounded like something third grader on the playground would offer rather than presidential candidate an hour after the debate trump immediately began walking back his statement and denied he had ever said it this type of shamelessness is difficult to combat when asked it sounds like you admitted you haven paid federal taxes and that was smart is that what you meant to say trump replied no didn say that at all trump insulted every american who pays their fair share of taxes and cuban was not amused nor impressed after the debate cuban said get audited every year my taxes are it takes me minutes just to sign all the different taxes that have to spend and tell my tax lawyers and everybody you know take advantage of do what the law recommends but not against paying taxes and ll give you perfect example when the dallas mavericks were building new practice facility which was just opening had the opportunity to go to dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything didn do it couple years ago we had some issues in dallas just wrote check to the general treasury this year we had after the shootings in orlando had concerns about the lgbt community in dallas just wrote million dollar check to the city of dallas to support bunch of different programs the luckiest guy in the world there nobody who been as blessed as me and my family so far knock on wood is healthy and at some point you have to realize you have to give back and you have to realize that this is country that been great to us and you can just take take take take take take mcuban on trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart debatenight pic twitter com upnunatukv stefan becket becket september the contrast between cuban and trump could not be more stark cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him while admitting he owes his success to society trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible while offering to pay back nothing did trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes no did trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes no trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent because if they did they would certainly not support him trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made chinese goods to which his name is affixed in trump world there is two tiered system one for him and one for everyone else add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the president crimes impeach donald trump

former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative chai distributed watered down hiv aids drugs to patients in sub saharan africa and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality according to draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation the congressional report titled the clinton foundation and the india success story was initiated by rep marsha blackburn tennessee republican and vice chair of the house energy and commerce committee the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundation most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative the congressional report focused on clinton decade long relationship with controversial indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy which chai used as one of its main distributors of hiv aids drugs to third world countries it also highlighted the work of dinesh thakur former ranbaxy employee who became star whistleblower and permitted the government to launch landmark lawsuit against the indian firm the company was vulnerable to prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the market ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce the department of justice further levied million fine and forfeiture on the company this is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the district of maryland and the nation largest financial penalty paid by generic pharmaceutical company said attorney for the district of maryland rod rosenstein when ranbaxy pleaded guilty when companies sell adulterated drugs they undermine the integrity of the fda approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard ineffective or unsafe said stuart delery acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the department of justice when the government announced its action against the indian company the department of justice stated in its final settlement alleged due to the company diluted drugs it subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality according to the report the question becomes how many people lost their lives how many people found it was false promise asked blackburn in an interview with thedcnf the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clinton campaign blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the department of health and human services and to the department of state where hillary served as secretary of state during president barack obama first term the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indian americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration fda and the securities and exchange commission the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundation vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the watered down drugs propublica estimated that in alone the agency for international development allocated million to ranbaxy and delivered more than million packages substandard hiv medicines cause health problems for patients perhaps even accelerating death from hiv related infections roger bate an economist at the american enterprise institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines told thedcnf thakur told thedcnf that many of the company anti retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in aids patients these drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients if the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label you will not see the platelet levels or the wbc levels stabilize he said ranbaxy first public hint of problems occurred in august one year after chai began working with the firm the world health organization reported irregularities involving three ranbaxy drugs in south africa according to the report the fda sent public warning letter to ranbaxy in about reported irregularities in the company quality control efforts it concluded that the drugs which included anti retroviral hiv aids medications show much lower potencies in these batches although ranbaxy generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the chai and the former president continue to praise ranbaxy and distribute the company hiv aid drugs to patients abroad bill heaped praise on ranbaxy in during speech in mumbai saying the drugs saved millions of lives neither chai nor the clinton foundation have announced they severed ties with ranbaxy thakur said he now public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on access to patients the whistleblower tried to meet with chai and clinton foundation officials but was only met with silence have tried to reach out to them he told thedcnf but haven had great amount of success with the clinton foundation chai was part of the clinton foundation until when it spun off into separate entity the groups still have some overlapping board members and staff and they continue to operate in close coordination bill clinton for example is deeply involved with both organizations charles ortel wall street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the clinton foundation claims their separation was deeply suspect in the application trustees of the new entity including bill clinton falsely claim the entity is not successor to previous efforts this is not true they purposefully obscure the fact that similar operation called chai was by far the largest piece of the original foundation ortel told thedcnf the congressional study suggests bill may have relaxed quality standards in executive order he signed an executive order that relaxed intellectual property policy standards promising the government would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any sub saharan country relating to hiv aids medicines or technologies the report states chai announced in october it was going to distribute generic low cost hiv drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers ranbaxy cipla of mumbai india matrix labs of hydrabad india aspen pharmacare of johannesburg south africa chai endorsement also allowed ranbaxy to manufacture hiv drugs that would be bought by the government under the president emergency plan for aids relief billion initiative proposed by former president george bush the flow of funds combined with clinton endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become good acquisition targets according to the study ranbaxy filed abbreviated new drug applications three of which were approved by the fda according to the congressional study eventually the firm would produce generic hiv drugs the companies enjoyed great financial profits and they exploded as they partnered with the foundation for several years the report states the study also examined the key players in the clinton chai orbit the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the clinton foundation in terms of donor contributions one relationship unearthed by the report was the american indian foundation which clinton co founded with indian american businessmen rajat gupta and vinod gupta in rajat was convicted of insider trading in in sensational trial vinod eventually was forced to resign as ceo and chairman of the company infogroup and was fined million in securities and exchange commission investigation one of the charges stated vinod had awarded bill million without board approval blackburn says the worst part of the story were the false hopes offered by the clinton foundation you think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients to me it disturbing and very sad she said the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those

there is moment at every donald trump rally when donald trump marvels at the crazy spectacle he created is there any place in america as fun as donald trump rally he asks with mischievous pursed lip grin the moment always comes after protester tries to interrupt him only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming trump trump trump that the fun part the joint release of pent up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect americans when you experience it in person you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and mexicans and muslims taking over their country gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying merry christmas donald trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues chain saw artist named chris cox the founder of bikers trump told me at recent pensacola rally story continued below when trump fans are asked about his appeal the first thing they usually say is that he isn normal politician and his rambling fear mongering name calling public speeches no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter do not feel like normal political events they feel like wrestlemania with different kind of hero and different kind of performance art they feel like revival meetings for the donald trump church of cultural resentment with ritual denunciations of crooked hillary clinton barack obama we call him president obama because we have to treat him with respect right and other enemies of the congregation at time when americans say they re tired of politics as usual trump offers politics as deeply often disturbingly always unusual his opponent does not clinton events feel exactly like normal political events she may be the world most famous and polarizing woman but she running an almost generic democratic campaign politics as very usual tonight hillary clinton will take on donald trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories policy agendas and bases of support but their contrasting records and ideas haven been the defining divides of this strange political year what is really about is conventional versus not and no matter what happens tonight when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events you re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is trump he is violating all the rules of the political game rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency and when is over it not clear whether those rules will still apply whatever you think of clinton she tends to observe polite society political traditions which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who attended modern campaign stop the backdrops are decorated with red white and blue bunting and talking point slogans like love trumps hate or stronger together the small venues are selected to target niche groups millennials last week at temple university in philadelphia the disabled few days later at family outreach center in orlando and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises the speeches are standard campaign fare dotted with wonky statistics and real person anecdotes to buttress well researched policy proposals the candidate as she has for nearly four decades in public life sticks to her prepared text her audiences are supportive though not particularly emotive thought it was very substantial very specific glenn mccoy an adult educator at catholic church who wore hil yes pin to clinton speech about supporting disabled workers in orlando the purpose wasn to whip the crowd into frenzy we re not looking to choose president based on emotion clinton had better hope not there electricity at trump rallies that hers can match it no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the trump shows live his crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies like nascar fans waiting for wrecks and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media the job stealing chinese the pc sensitivity snobs who think you re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and islamic terrorists out of the country it entertaining to watch him violate norms declaring clinton lacks the stamina to be president suggesting her security detail ought to disarm warning the election will probably be rigged he flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate the savagery of inner cities even the temperature at his rallies it degrees in here and that considered cool for an auditorium he casually drops one outlandish bombshell the federal reserve is corrupt the fbi is covering up for clinton nafta was the worst deal in the history of the world then moves onto another before the last fully explodes clinton doesn do that whatever one thinks about her email protocols or benghazi or her penchant for secrecy she campaigns like typical candidate she has the strengths and weaknesses of typical public servant and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public her problem is that trump unique combination of insult comedy and monster truck rally despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace is exposing the focus grouped stage managed paint by numbers nature of typical candidacies clinton isn getting lot of credit for following the rules of game that always seemed inauthentic nobody understands that better than the political savant named donald trump he tells lot of straight faced falsehoods about clinton campaign like his accusations that it policy free when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals and when trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop but there something to his caricature of clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear at rally in miami he did sly imitation of clinton speeches he claimed with faux specificity that they re only minutes when they re usually twice that long with bored expression that suggested she just phones them in bom bom bom see ya trump smirked see ya going home many americans really do seem sick of bom bom bom see ya politics but the live experience of trump say anything middle finger alternative can be bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he shredding every day before attending recent trump rally in pensacola watched video of his last rally there during the republican primary in january at the time the news from the event had been his just saying speculation that questions about ted cruz citizenship might be disqualifying but starting with the star spangled banner performed by kids group that later sued trump for breach of contract the entire rally seemed like trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet trump spent the first minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the bad dishonest very bad people in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds theme he revisited three more times he criticized soldier for using the word sir to address the iranians who briefly captured him he advised americans to take their money out of the stock market which he described as big fat bubble and predicted collapse that would be beautiful to watch he gleefully pointed out black man in the stands didn put him there not paying him he read long poem about deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of syrian refugees called himself more militaristic than anyone in this room complained that common core education bureaucrats make year actually the president salary and announced the american dream was dead oh he also unleashed diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled whoever the hell brought this mic system don pay the son of bitch he seethed don pay em don pay em you know believe in paying but when somebody does bad job like this stupid mic you shouldn pay the bastard terrible you gotta be tough with your people because they ll pay they don care so we re not going to pay guarantee not paying for this mic so was ready for more theater of the bizarre when trump returned eight months later to pensacola seat arena which was once again packed to capacity vendors sold trump that bitch shirts and trump confederate flags the pastor giving the invocation shouted tyranny has raised its ugly head our constitution is under attack the crowd started chanting lock her up before trump even appeared he then took the stage to tremendous roar and well to be honest he seemed lot less provocative than had expected he freeing up our speech said one trump supporter we can talk about the muslim invasion we can be against amnesty maybe we ll be able to say merry christmas again trump was now using teleprompter which he had derided as tool of inauthenticity in january and while he used it more as guideline than script it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff written clich and republican talking points about encrusted insiders and turning the page he said the kind of things regular politicians say the history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday and once again we ll have government of by and for the people he even recited the monotonous details of military investment plan conservative think tank had prepared for him name checking new naval vessels in town with naval base the crowd was noisier and angrier than normal political crowd during one trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty supporter in red white and blue trucker hat screamed what about white people but the rally still felt at least quasi normal trump did repeat few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them like percent tax on imports and his mexico financed wall but really who still thinks about them afterwards though saw breaking story about an offhand comment trump had made warning that if iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at americans when he was president as they apparently had during minor incident few weeks earlier their ships would be blown out of the water trump had essentially threatened to launch world war and hadn noticed back at my hotel checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused clinton of causing all the problems in the world including north korean nuclear tests that began under george bush he had mused that personally think she an unstable person and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldn be prosecuted ok he had denied cozying up to russian dictator vladimir putin and then he had cozied up again he been nice to me and if he nice to me that fine if we got along with russia that wouldn be so bad would it and at time of low unemployment cheap gas and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in at the fastest rate in decades trump had flatly declared that the country is collapsing those all would have been jaw dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate but the year of trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid fire transgressions we re normalizing the unprecedented at rally few days later in asheville trump called the military incredibly weak defended male spectator who roughed up year old female protester and said the black community which endured slavery and jim crow was in the worst shape they ve ever been ever ever ever yet the main trump story from the associated press focused on how he had refrained from attacking clinton over her bout with pneumonia under the headline restraint on clinton health shows new campaign discipline predictably trump mocked clinton health problems later in the week suggesting she needed more sleep warning she didn have enough energy to handle the rigors of the white house falsely claiming he was holding four rallies day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn make it through one that sort of behavior just hasn been seen on the presidential campaign trail but it that defiant you can tell me what supposed to say spirit that trump loyalists love he not politician nobody controls him lot of us are tired of worrying about people feelings always watching our and so it cool to see him speak his mind said alan smith year old firefighter from nearby gulf breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension bill turpin retired army veteran from brayton iowa told me at trump rally outside des moines that while clinton is classic politician for whom lying is like breathing he doesn even believe the official story about her health because he fainted once and he didn stumble around like she did on the video trump is businessman with nothing to fear he ll call spade spade and if you don like it you can shove it again and again trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness standing up for their right to primal scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and black lives matter thugs he freeing up our speech said norris westfall an auto detailer who wore an infowars liberty or death shirt to recent trump rally in asheville we can talk about the muslim invasion we can be against amnesty without everyone saying we re offensive maybe we ll be able to say merry christmas again it fashionable to attribute the trump phenomenon to economic anxiety but the trump voters interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety they seemed less anxious about the state of the obama economy than the rise of the multicultural obama coalition and they seemed less anxious than pissed off at president many of them still consider foreign usurper at thought leaders more worried about islamophobia than islamic terror at racial guilt trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black on black crime in asheville watched an air force veteran named gary latham explode at some anti trump protesters who were chanting that they didn want hate in their state lazy motherfuckers get fucking job he explained to me that america was under siege with thousands of syrian refugees embedded in western carolina and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant americans clinton considered deplorable the trump voters interviewed seemed less anxious about the obama economy than the rise of the multicultural obama coalition and they seemed less anxious than pissed off one of the speakers before trump took the stage in asheville was white haired lady who owns custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature she used the opportunity to proclaim we want our state rights back we re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats says kim buckner nursing assistant who wore don tread on me pin to the asheville rally trump is saying what we re all thinking screw you call us deplorable all you want our rights don end where your feelings begin trump echoes those anti anti racism tropes describing accusations of racism as the oldest play in the democratic playbook and he begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner city life arguing that it so hellish blacks might as well vote trump ll say it openly and some people don like it don really care what do you have to lose his long riffs about how he ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non racist whites but in person they feel much more like creepy concern trolling for the benefit of jeering trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals when trump claims that black youths don get an education and have an unemployment rate of percent the real rate is about one third of that he fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white supremacy sites he retweets every now and then the trump supporters interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles bemoaning their dependence on government and blaming their president polls show that most trump supporters still think obama was born in kenya and many spoke to believe he also muslim who supports isis one notable exception was richard cohen jewish contractor who attended the rally in asheville cohen told me trump is pandering to racism anti semitism and fear of hispanics among his supporters he said white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier trump event after hearing spectators yell the word but cohen supports trump anyway because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid finger in the wind political establishment lot of us who like him don like the stuff he says about race cohen said obviously some do this really isn normal and while clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal first lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern secretary of state who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams she presents herself on the trail as dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to bigoted freak remember watching her execute similar strategy in when she ran for senate seat in new york even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office even though her husband was still in the white house after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation she simply ignored the weirdness of it all running as standard issue democrat in democratic state diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered and against basically normal republican candidate it worked majority of new yorkers agreed with her agenda and sent her to the senate to pursue it in though clinton has struggled to make case for normal she tried to push standard issue democratic agenda but in the year of trump the race hasn been about standard anything nearly one of every five americans lives with disability and just about everyone else wishes them the best so clinton orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an inclusive economy to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium in the corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state clinton spoke to supporters much smaller crowd than trump regularly attracts but far more diverse about her goal of an america that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens she also laid out four part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled americans flourish in the economy just two months before election day the speech was designed to illustrate clinton concern about worthy issue it did that more or less afterwards her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose her depth of knowledge her willingness to listen nobody mentioned eloquence or flair but her people understand that she never hosted reality show thought it was nice speech lewis smith retired mechanic in orlando told me afterwards not very exciting but believe she ll do what she says the speech started slowly as clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters few made for tv soundbites about the riots in charlotte and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone her speechwriters clearly cut and pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle class origins her support for family friendly policies like paid leave and plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from alzheimer disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators the rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled americans who have been undervalued by society for too long it was nice sentiment expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control across the country people with disabilities are running businesses teaching students caring for our loved ones they re holding public office making breakthrough scientific discoveries reporting the news and creating art that inspires and challenges us maybe some disabled americans create uninspiring art but not in hillary clinton speeches in the united states of america the greatest country in the world we believe that everyone is created equal clinton said this kind of boilerplate scores lot higher in truth value than in news value clinton did talk about her own work with the disabled from her push for their right to attend school as young children defense fund lawyer to her appointment of the state department first ever advisor for disability rights she mentioned disabled people she known including the unbelievably good looking actor christopher reeve who told her that family values should mean that every family has value and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity she then detailed her plan which while infinitely more substantive than anything trump has ever said about disabilities was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses plus an elimination of the sub minimum wage that is currently paid to some disabled workers the audience responded with warmth if not exuberance but must confess that after watching trump claim obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die really slow vicious death to exhaust them accuse the federal reserve and the justice department of corruption and tell his supporters he doesn feel bad if they re working harder than ever because he is too clinton scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull she gave laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic but it felt like political speech combination of virtue signaling and interest group outreach cable covered trump rally instead and was rewarded when boxing promoter don king dropped an bomb in his introduction there was nothing controversial or unpredictable in clinton remarks they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework and that unlike trump who talks mostly about himself she knows enough to portray herself as part of team she didn even mention trump reprehensible imitation of disabled reporter because she wanted more positive message that day she was careful to say nothing impolitic which is basically politics geannie bastian student with cerebral palsy said her political awakening came when trump made fun of that reporter believe me ve seen that gesture lot but before it was always from children she said trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew in fairness to clinton there was portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched the disabled and their families joe kilsheimer the mayor of central florida suburb has younger brother who was written off by doctors as hopeless case when he was baby but went on to become the first eagle scout with down syndrome and lead productive life what hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home kilsheimer said know lot of people don trust her because they see her filtered through politics and media but she got heart geannie bastian university of central florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in wheelchair said she was moved by clinton message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential but she said her real political awakening came when trump made fun of that reporter whose hand looks quite similar to hers believe me ve seen that gesture lot but before it was always from children she said trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew political scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm voters only get to vote once no matter how fired up they are but they re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren fired up in any case even at her own events it lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of trump than it is to find avid clinton fans voters of color seem especially riled repeatedly heard from black democrats offended by trump crusade to deny that the first african american president was american and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose my daughter has doctorate her husband is an orthodontist we ve got plenty to lose said betty edwards retired educator in the orlando suburbs there never been candidate who thought so little of us many hispanics are similarly energized by trump calls for mass deportations and wall sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country andy gutierrez singer and puerto rican voting activist who brought boricua vota sign to the orlando event says trump has been one man registration machine he thinks we re all mexicans and we re all bad gutierrez said people aren super excited about hillary but trust me they ll come out to stop trump clinton excitement problem is real problem at her university event in philadelphia millennials who had swooned over bernie sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe reasonably reliable accountant she ok guess said thomas davidenko freshman at temple my main worry is trump fingers on the nuclear code but say she knows what she doing in orlando met more actual clinton fans especially older women who admired her as feminist trailblazer but even her staunch supporters said they re struggling to persuade friends lou smith union cell tower technician for at said many of his arab hating white colleagues at work think she typical lying politician so they re voting for trump and her bernie loving daughters think the same thing so they re staying home she been around so long and republicans have thrown so much mud on her he said she great on the issues but it hard to get people to focus on that clinton is policy wonk and one could imagine that more normal campaign against more normal republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse she could have focused on taxes and health insurance climate change and diplomacy she might have framed the election as the democratic bottom up approach that produced prosperity during her husband administration and recovery during obama with the trickle down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under bush when bill clinton was in the chair everybody was doing great and then everything fell apart before obama fixed it said jeneka lloyd who owns small painting business in orlando man hillary should talk about that but trump is not normal republican and hasn focused on his policies because they re so insubstantial and flexible because he trashed bush as well as obama because he has gift for changing the subject with colorful fox news interviews or incendiary tweets and because his business record charity scams and racial provocations provide such target rich environment beyond the issues it lot harder to persuade americans of the magical thinking behind trump plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating gold star family looting his own charitable foundation refusing to release his tax returns and other unheard of behavior meanwhile the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major party presidential nominee with the lone exception of donald trump so clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud wrestling match with pig they ve both gotten dirty and neither she nor the public has liked it tonight on long island trump and clinton will meet in very conventional setting and as usual no one really has any idea how trump will try to handle it which is big part of what makes him so compelling on television his team is already warning moderator lester holt not to fact check the candidates which makes sense given trump distant relationship with facts there will be rules governing the debate but trump political brand is all about breaking the rules what is clear is that trump will portray himself as the candidate of change which is exactly what he is he essentially wants to roll back the obama era repealing the president health care reforms wall street reforms and climate rules as well as the obama approach to the economy and the war on terror but trump represents just as dramatic change from the way politics has been practiced in the tv era upending every assumption about what is gaffe what is disqualifying and what you just can say if you want to sit in the oval office and represent an entire nation if he uses tonight debate to brag about his genitalia or invite the russians to hack his opponent well it won be normal but it won be the first time either and yes even though she unlikely to put it this way clinton represents the status quo not just continuation of democratic policies but continuation of the conventional rules of politics she playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played and it wouldn feel so stilted if her opponent hadn started playing experimental honky tonk the question for is whether americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they ll turn to the politics of trump that question will be decided not by the thousands of americans who flock to trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see clinton but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend political event but the question beyond is what will happen to politics as usual americans never liked it and trump has helped expose how cautious contrived and anodyne it can be but he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for living that if caution restraint premeditated choreography and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren the most authentic elements of successful political leadership they re part of it and while politics as usual does have some bogus kabuki theater qualities it also reflects some baseline values showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren like you staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences that have constrained politicians in good way it not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms trump has shattered back together and while we may not have liked them we might miss them when they re gone not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted and trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future michael grunwald is senior staff writer for politico magazine

hbo real time host bill maher someone not often inclined to side with donald trump said that trump is right about profiling in the context of how to deal with terrorism here what he said he is for profiling that what he said but he said we should do it the way israel does and like every once in while donald trump says something right because we profile already we just do it stupidly all police work is profiling discrimination does not mean prejudice discrimination means telling un like things apart what they do is they hire really smart people this is not the tsa which is just guys giggling at your balls when they re looking screener if we would pay people to do this job we could get the kind of people who do it in israel and again we re just talking about few questions we re not talking about the rubber hose or sending you to black site mean don think this is too much of sacrifice to ask he definitely right about the tsa their scanners and pat down agents don do anything to prevent terrorism not only has the tsa caught zero terrorists and stopped zero terrorist attacks they have failure rate that means that they ll catch contraband roughly of the time the rest of the time it gets through it wonder that we haven dealt with another style attack over the past years how does an institution with such an abysmal track record even exist dumb question know it government so of course it going to be nothing but expensive and ineffective the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerising com

litany of economic and security issues clinton who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history faces new challenge with trump she is preparing for trump to confront her on litany of uncomfortable subjects ranging from her email scandal to bill clinton infidelity to her health trump showed he was willing to go there tuesday when he tweeted hillary clinton is taking the day off again she needs the rest sleep well hillary see you at the debate just watched they can say that on debate stage can they replay more videos must watch they can say that on debate stage can they clinton in radio interview tuesday said she was ready to deal with trump attacks am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent clinton said tuesday on the steve harvey radio show can take it steve can take that kind of stuff have been at this understand it is contact sport to knock trump off his game people advising clinton have been looking for one line retort that will be memorable moment from the contest clinton has spent hours watching highlight reel of trump republican primary debates according to several people familiar with her debate preparation she took notes on what agitated him particularly in his exchanges with rival ted cruz and studied his style but democrats worry the first debate will give trump chance to show more moderate controlled side while millions of people watch possibly for the first time this according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state is not lost on clinton clinton told supporters at an august fundraiser that friend told her there will be about million people watching and million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time so don assume they have followed anything there will be lot of new impressions to be made that night clinton said team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort including ron klain who advised obama and karen dunn long time lawyer and aide she is not setting up formal debate camp aides said but intends to be secluded at her home in chappaqua new york in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on monday clinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about trump policy personality and politics including receiving input from tony schwartz who was the co author for art of the deal the best seller about trump expectations game clinton aides worry that they can lower expectations enough ahead of the event for all his lack of substance trump showmanship as ex reality tv star makes him formidable debate foe he thrashed his rivals in gop debates brian fallon clinton national press secretary tweeted in august with her senate contests in and along with more than two dozen debates with barack obama in and nine meetings with bernie sanders in this primary campaign she has stood on debate stage more than times trump will not be the first unconventional opponent clinton has faced in debate clinton all but ended her senate race against rick lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the republican representative approached her lectern with piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules lazio bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and clinton handily beat him by points in november just watched debate expectations game is serious business replay more videos must watch debate expectations game is serious business her debate last fall against four democratic primary opponents was seen as an outright win for the secretary of state because of the way she handled prickly questions including about whether she is progressive enough for the current bent of the democratic party progressive but progressive who likes to get things done clinton said rolling out line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning clinton performances have not been without missteps however the former senator from new york cited the september terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to wall street response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by vermont sen bernie sanders attacking her on the issue which trump will show up in the last few weeks as clinton has publicly turned to more affirmative message the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks clinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep lid on leaks about clinton debate process preferring not to telegraph to the trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate when asked about the debates clinton has tried to laud trump debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have strong showing at hofstra do not know which donald trump will show up clinton said at an august fundraiser in new york maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey gravity that he hasn done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points
hillary clinton prepares for unpredictable trump at presidential debate
kallstadt germany few places in germany are as representative of the country heartland as kallstadt the village in which republican presidential candidate donald trump grandfather was born and from which he was later deported the hamlet of people lies nestled among vineyard covered hills about an hour and half drive southwest of frankfurt it has one bakery and one butcher every year kallstadt holds the saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy pig stomach filled with pork herbs bratwurst and diced potatoes trump may have captured large swath of the american electorate with his signature blend of populism nativism and brazenness and yet in the hometown of his forefather he remains distinctly unpopular in fact few politicians are less popular in germany than trump study by the pew research center found out that only percent of the country finds him trustworthy since local newspaper discovered that johannes steiniger member of the german parliament was distantly related to trump the year old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate with his statements about gay people and foreigners or with the language he uses and with his derogative statements about hillary clinton trump seems to do everything he can so that we get negative image of him steiniger tells politico trump rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in kallstadt he stands for everything that bad says sarah hler yelling to be heard over the person brass band celebrating the saumagenkerwe in the town main square hler is former local wine princess the victor of beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry this year new dish appeared in the town annual festival saumagen ner fusion of the local specialty with turkish kebab everyone is welcome to join us here no matter what color they are says hler pink purple doesn matter tanja huber the year old incumbent regional wine princess nods her head in agreement since the prospect of trump presidency first became evident late last year reporters have descended on kallstadt seeking bit of local color quote or two and perhaps some hometown pride they don get that we really don give damn about trump says huber he never been here and he apparently doesn care about us either donald grandfather friedrich trump was born in kallstadt into vintner family on march previous generations of the trump family used variant spellings of the name including trump dromb and trumpff according to local historians or even drumpf according to family history by gwenda blair but by the time friedrich was born they had settled on trump germany did not yet exist as nation kallstadt was part of the province of palatinate in the bavarian kingdom the region was going though rough times unemployment was high those who had the courage left friedrich father died when he was eight years old and his mother struggled to make ends meet at years old friedrich decided to follow his sister katharina who had emigrated to the united states two years earlier he arrived in new york on board the eider on october he entered the through official channels but he had left bavaria illegally both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service said roland paul the recently retired director of the institute for palatinate regional history and folklife studies in the city of kaiserslautern according to documents uncovered by paul friedrich was stripped of his bavarian citizenship as his own request four years after arriving in the but friedrich was not done with palatinate seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister according to the family history by blair five years after that he returned once more to kallstadt where he met year old elisabeth christ they were engaged and friedrich came back third time to marry her in august but while the couple moved back to new york soon after the marriage and had daughter friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the and return to the land of their birth my grandmother said will marry you but will not go back to america with you donald trump american born cousin john walter told german filmmaker simone wendel in friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise in he applied for permission to travel to kallstadt and although he claimed in his application that he intended to return to the united states within year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein he took all his savings from the with him according to blair family history back in kallstadt friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back but though he secured the support of local authorities the district government put halt to his plans on february deportation notice was sent to the town office of kallstadt declaring that friedrich was to be told he has to leave bavarian state territory by may of this year at the latest friedrich was able to obtain three month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill but eventually he and his wife pregnant once more had no choice but to board the ship pennsylvania on july and return to new york shortly after that donald father fred trump junior was born the authorities said you are not german citizen you gave up your citizenship you have to leave says walter so they left and they went back to america and that why donald and are here friedrich now named frederick died in may of the spanish flu his widow survived her first husband by years and visited kallstadt many times during her life in february simone wendel the german filmmaker from kallstadt was given an audience with donald trump roughly two years earlier she had begun work on kings of kallstadt documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown donald trump and henry john heinz the inventor of heinz ketchup for months wendel had tried to arrange meeting with trump but his office had not replied to her letters she was only able to secure visit with the help of walter trump cousin who had visited kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history on the day of her visit wendel stood nervously next to walter in conference room on one of trump tower top floors she had brought linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw on tops her plan was to sit down with walter and trump for coffee and cake the traditional afternoon snack in her home region but when she asked trump staff to make some coffee the only reaction she got was irritated faces his assistant just couldn be bothered she says hello john trump said when he entered the room shaking his cousin hand and looking confused at wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her trump sat down in front of one meter long model of his boeing airliner and panoramic window overlooking new york central park wendel trying to remedy the situation pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it afterwards just kept on thinking what on earth did do she says the cake looks really good trump said and he and wendel ended up talking for almost an hour until trump still claimed his family was swedish version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti german sentiment in the during the two world wars but by the time wendel visited he had become proud of his german roots they grow them well in kallstadt he told her during their meeting they grow them very well believe me it good stock wow it beautiful trump said when she handed him picture of the house where his grandfather was born an inconspicuous one story building with gable roof that fantastic see how well maintained it is everything is perfectly maintained it

as my th wedding anniversary approached tried to be creative in buying gifts for my wife had the idea of silver coin that marked years of something or other went to local coin shop and as idled over some of the display cases noticed set of coins from the mid th century oddly the coins from the and were large up until when the coins started becoming at best half the size of the others oh the panic of the owner said when asked him about the change of size it was really bad the president didn seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins story continued below now that is inept presidential decision making during the current election campaign there has been lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility that whoever the winner is he or she will be so terrible as leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence and before the current candidates were known the two most recent white house occupants barack obama and george bush have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country but obama and bush can both take heart and donald trump and hillary clinton can gain solace perhaps from knowing that no matter how badly they do they almost certainly won rank last by my reckoning that place belongs to james buchanan genial man though he was ve made quite study of him my innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at let say the lesser presidents my father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with biography of franklin pierce everywhere we went he forced me to read historical plaques stopping the car in shrieking halt at times to view them if were to write book about president it surely wouldn be about washington or lincoln or even silent cal coolidge it would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible buchanan the only president from my native state pennsylvania turned out to be my man start with his anemic minimalist solution to one of america great financial downturns for long time before buchanan in effect precipitated the panic of things were going well for the country at least in an economic sense there had been bad downturn years before with multiple causes like war in europe the dissolution of the bank of the united states and overspeculation in oddly enough slaves and western land the great acquisition of land under president james knox polk from oregon to california to texas reinvigorated the economy and boom lasted for the next two decades railroads were the big player since so many people wanted to move west into the new territories and states manufacturing boomed domestically and then with foreign trade as well since europe had quelled many of its hostilities and american items were cheaper than those on the continent then the day before buchanan took office congress passed what he wanted the tariff bill of which lowered tariffs on panoply of items from abroad buchanan wanted to stimulate foreign trade but made american manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive three days later came the real fatal blow though the dred scott supreme court decision which fell on the shoulders of buchanan the case had wound through state and federal courts for at least decade but roger taney the supreme court chief justice and fellow alumnus with buchanan of small dickinson college wanted it settled scott was slave to military man who at times was stationed not in his native missouri slave state but in the northwest territories which were nonslave after his master died scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory buchanan wanted to be hero and thought if the case could be decided broadly it could settle the question of slavery in the union for good buchanan knew too though that the court had five southerners and four northerners and if the decision were split that way it would be ineffective he and taney had apparently agreed to have narrower decision or remand the case back to the appeals court if it were merely sectional since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate ignoring the idea of separation of powers though buchanan browbeat robert cooper grier another dickinson alumnus and justice from pennsylvania to go along with the majority opinion which taney would write eventually new york native justice samuel nelson wrote concurring opinion making the vote even less sectional legend has it that taney on the capitol stairs just before he gave buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration told buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate that and that he would be all for whatever the court decided two days later the decision came down taney castigated scott whom he said was not citizen being slave and thus could not bring any suit he also wrote that the constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or conversely prohibit slavery thus all the compromises about it going back to the were invalid and in fact the fugitive slave law requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country was in force historically experts rate dred scott as the worst decision in the court history but short of that it was at the very least for the country with not just taney but surely buchanan responsible for it as appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time there was practical downside too now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go west to use the railroads or to start business that railroads might profit from railroad stocks started to decline in value and then contagion hit and it was free fall by midsummer no one could take ride on the reading as uncle pennybags does in the monopoly game since the reading railroad had shut down as did lines now and then famous like the illinois central several lines like the delaware lackawanna and western and the fond du lac railroad in wisconsin declared bankruptcy thousands were thrown out of work and banks started foreclosing on loans and property senator william seward the leader of the new republican party come home from vacation to find out he had lost most everything he owned his stock in the illinois central promoted to him by his rival democrat stephen douglas was virtually worthless every bank in new york city effectively closed none would convert coins or gold into bank notes the oldest grain company in new york wolfe and co failed in august as did the most prominent insurance business in the country the ohio life insurance and trust co buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria calm words might have quelled it but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and thus more turmoil in markets the residue that mattered most though was the reaction caused by dred scott instead of promoting unity and opening up the west to more settlement as buchanan had thought dred scott thwarted it and brought an end to years of northern prosperity yet the south did not succumb as badly its agrarian culture was self sustaining and its cotton still had market in europe there was surge in arms sales there as well the economic downturn in the north exacerbating regional tensions the relative good times in the south caused northerners of all parties to further blame buchanan for being southern lackey buchanan response was underwhelming almost disdainful he said the federal government could do nothing in his annual message in december he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the panic but he would do nothing for individual suffering the government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started but would begin no new ones he said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and deserved the gambler fate eventually he noted the youth and energy of the rugged american individuals would triumph though there would clearly be an interim of rough times in sense he was right because it took the rugged young americans who went to war in to bring the economy back throughout his term when fork appeared in the road buchanan managed to take the wrong turn when hostilities flared in kansas over whether that territory would enter as slave or free state buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid exacerbating the killings some done by the wild eyed anti slavery radical john brown when later brown seized arms with small cadre of followers in harpers ferry west virginia just miles from washington along the potomac buchanan again diddled before consulting robert lee who had fortuitously been home in arlington on leave from his post in texas lee quickly went to harpers ferry to capture brown and quell the raid in other ventures though buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions he caused chaos in utah quelling what he thought to be mormon revolt causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely jurisdictional dispute he supported mercenary william walker forays to conquer nicaragua and guatemala and sent troops to try to annex parts of paraguay primarily to acquiesce to his southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union then there was the little known pig war started when settler along the canadian border on the san juan straits in the northwest shot pig owned by the hudson bay co that wandered onto his property standoff ensued until buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding kansas where there was real problem out to calm the nonfatal except to one pig battle this was at time when there were about only soldiers in the army stretched as thin as could be as the election of came close buchanan refused to support the one democrat who could win stephen douglas because he just plain didn like him that caused the party to split into three factions each nominating candidate virtually ensuring republican abraham lincoln the election the southern states which had threatened secession started doing so during the interim between lincoln election and his inauguration in march thus under buchanan watch buchanan took the unusual position that the constitution did not allow secession but the president could not do anything to prevent it as the first half dozen states seceded buchanan lost several cabinet members he had lot of southern allies and refused entreaties by many including former president john tyler who would himself become confederate congressman to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold meanwhile buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the south fort sumter enter lincoln who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms speeches as the greatest of presidents lincoln no doubt was man with plans and savvy but contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no james buchanan the worst president ever there would have been few notches more on the presidential rating scale for abe lincoln to climb today george bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history thanks to his authorship of the iraq war and his presiding over the crash of and the beginning of the great recession obama is sometimes seen in the same light especially by the far right but as happened with honest abe and his predecessor perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for president hillary clinton or president donald trump to shine robert strauss is author of the forthcoming worst president ever james buchanan the potus rating game and the legacy of the least of the lesser presidents
